  Need to work out details of approval process in terms of data changes
  and the web pages needed to support those changes. [Need "edit entry"
  page first]

  Changeset 49 (mercurial id cd0e594f54a0) includes editor approval and 
  rejection capability including entry deletion and (untested) concurrency 
  handling.
  
  Still to do: testing, editor login, diffs between old and new entries,
  security review.

  In current rev 2ca1e8193b3a editor login, diffs, etc have been implemented
  and process flow seems to work though the ui needs improvement (with
  complex trees of changes, it can be hard to sort out the dependencies.)
