  Need to work out details of approval process in terms of data changes
  and the web pages needed to support those changes. [Need "edit entry"
  page first]

  Changeset 49 (mercurial id cd0e594f54a0) includes editor approval and 
  rejection capability including entry deletion and (untested) concurrency 
  handling.
  
  Still to do: testing, editor login, diffs between old and new entries,
  security review.
