  Need to limit number entries shown on "search results" page to some
  reasonable number to prevent trying to display huge results sets.

  Done in changeset 4db641976ecc.
  In srchres.py, we embed the generated search sql in a wrapper that 
  uses OFFSET and LIMIT to restrict results to desired page.  Page 
  parameters are passed through the srchres form with the Next Page 
  button.  Currently no navigation buttons to wander around inside
  large result set.  jmb ok with this per email 2009-02-23. "Re: 
  Simulated user submissions to jmdictdb".

  Also added some protect agaist DoS by excessive resource use, 
  especially acidently doing a search with no critera. Do a 
  Postgresql EXPLAIN on the query before running it.  If the cost 
  reported by EXPLAIN exceeds a threshold, the query is rejected.
