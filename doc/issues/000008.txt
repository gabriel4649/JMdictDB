  For api, command scripts, cgi pages.
  Will focus most testing effort, at least initially, on
  functional rather than unit tests.  See IS-7 for reasons.
  See IS-9 for details on the test infrastructure.

  Some initial tests committed 2008-06-22:e0b5a6d569b7.

  Checked in files kwginf.csv, kwkinf.csv, kwxxx.csv from 
  python/tests/data/kwds/ that are needed by the jdb_kwds tests
  but inadvertantly not provided in previous checkin.

  Added tests for revised jdb.jstr_classify() function (IS-26).
