  Need to setup a test infrastructure.

  Create python/tests/ for testing code, python/tests/data/ for 
  driver and expected results data.

  Desite that I am deemphesizing unit tests (see IS-7 for 
  reasons) in favor of functional tests (IS-8), will use 
  Python's unittest module for the testing framework because 
  it can do functional testing as well as unit testing, is 
  simple enough to be understandable, can be subclassed when 
  necessary to modify, and comes with python.

  Created runtests.py as a test driver, and unitttest_extensions.py
  to provide a better test runner, and working around the unicode
  exceptions problem (see IS-8).
