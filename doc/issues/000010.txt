  Need to find way to validate that db contents are same as jmdict.xml.
  Just generating xml from database and diffing with original file
  probably won't work because we don't maintain same order of entities,
  comment positions, and parhaps other things.  xref targets won't be
  identical.
  
  Maybe this could be done by generating a master file and letting Jim
  Breen do the validation against the current master file?
