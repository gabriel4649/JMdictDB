  Need to find way to validate that db contents are same as jmdict.xml.
  Just generating xml from database and diffing with original file
  probably won't work because we don't maintain same order of entities,
  comment positions, and parhaps other things.  xref targets won't be
  identical.
  
  Maybe this could be done by generating a master file and letting Jim
  Breen do the validation against the current master file?

  Being worked on by Jim [2007-07-26].

  Added new python module, fmtxml.py that will write an entry object
  as xml.  Also, in jmxml.py (contains generalized jmdict xml parsing
  functions factored out of jmparse.py) there is now a function that
  will extract the xml text for selected entries.  This offers the
  opportunity to create a validation program gets an entry object from
  the database, formats it to xml, and compares it to the xml of the
  same object extracted from the JMdict file.
  
  I have already done this on a selection of about 30 enties.
  The only discrepencies seen were:
  
    * order of tags.
    * propagation of pos tags to following senses.
    * gloss differences do to trans->lsrc conversion.
    * missing xx_pri items due to duplicate and conflict filtering
      in jmparse.py.
    * duplicates xx_pri items (probably related to IS-39).
    * (possibly some xref issues with senses.)
  
  However the test set of 30 entries does not cover some issues
  well (notably xrefs) so this cannot be considered vaidation yet.

  This has largely been done by jwb, suppported by recent changes 
  to jmdictdb to make xml element order more deterministic.
