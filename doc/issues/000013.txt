  Support PerlEx.  The author does a lot of the project development on a
  Windows machine and would like faster response both during devopment and
  for his own use of the project.  It would also be in keeping with the
  free-software nature of the project to make the software useful to the
  widest possible audience.
  
  PerlEx comes with Activestate's Perl and provides fast execution of cgi
  scripts under Microsoft's IIS web server in (I think) a similar way to
  modperl's Modperl::Request.

  Change to Python as the implementation language (IS-109) makes this 
  issue moot.
