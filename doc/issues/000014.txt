  Retrieving one or a set of jmdict entries involves executing ~20 sql
  select stements.  This takes anwhere from .8 to 30s on my (slow)
  development machine.  I don't understand this almost order-of-magnitutde
  variation.  Need to determine what's going on and find remedy.

  This issue was opened when the app code was in Perl.  I have not 
  noticed any extreme performance variations in recent versions of 
  Python code and Postgresql, so will close this.
