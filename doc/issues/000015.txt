  Even .8s seems a little slow (even for my machine).  DB interface code
  uses DBI's fetch_hash methods.  I think this may need to a second db
  read in order to determine the column names. Need to determine: 1) Is
  that ttrue?  2) Does it account for a significant performace hit? Will
  is still be a problem running with modperl which will improve query
  caching?  If these are true then rewrite code so that we provide the
  column name info rather than reading from db.

  Not sure when it happened (possibly as result of elimination of
  surrogate PKs in child tables) but object load times reported on the
  entr.pl page are now typically less the .3s on my development machine.
