  Will this help performance? Informal timings done on cgi show that
  connect time is pretty quick but may be more significant when object
  retrieval times are improved. (ref Apache::DBI)

  Closing this because it really needs to be considered in th context 
  of an entire web cgi redesign, in particular, usings a web framework
  or toolkit.  Have no quantatative results but gut feeling in that 
  connection time is a small fraction of ti,e needed for query execution
  and result retrieval, and given the low hit rate on the EDRDG jmdictdb 
  site, not worth doing right now.
