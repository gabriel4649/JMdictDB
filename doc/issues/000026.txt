  jmdict.pm -- The database expects text strings in table "rdng" to
  contain no kanji chars and in table "kanj" to contain at least one.
  Function jstr_classify used to determine kana/kanji-ness.  However there
  are some jmdict items that have kanji text that are not considered kanji
  by jmdict::jstr_classify:
  1000060: 々
  1000090: ◎
  1000090: ×
  1085560: トライ＆エラー (is reading but search thinks it's kanji)
  Change jstr_classify?  Or do something else?

  Also, jelparse.y uses kanji/kana test to identify kanji and reading
  sections, and also xrefs.  In 1000090, the xref [ant=×] gets mis-
  interpreted as a tag (like "pos=vs") because the "×" character is
  neither kanji or kana and results in a parse failure with error,
  "ANT is unrecognised tag type".

  Added check to jmparse.py that issues a warning to the log file if
  a <keb> element is processed that does not contain any kanji chars.
  When run on JMdict or JMnedict, a lot of such warnings occur, most
  due to failure of jdb.jstr_classify() to treat full-width equivalents
  of ascii characters as kanji.  In jdb.jstr_classify() changed the 
  unicode range defining "kanji" from 0x4E00-0x9FFF to 0x4E00-0xFFFF.
  However, the extended range is probably not right either as is 
  contains half-width katakana (FF61-FF9F) and the unicode surrogate
  range (D800-DFFF).

  There are similar warnings from JMnedict but in addition there are 
  a lot of kana-only <keb> texts.  See the following explanation by
  Jim Breen on the Edict mailing list:
    Subject: Re: [edict-jmdict] jmnedict non-kanji keb elements

  Will either wait for Jim to fix in JMnedict, or will have to try
  to detect and relocate during parsing.

  Perhaps we need some code from jstr_classify() that indicates
  characters that could be *either* kanji or kana?

  Just noticed that the above change fixes many "no kanji in keb"
  warnings when processing jmdict, it now causes many "no kana in 
  in "reb" warning when processing jmnedict!
  If seems that the full-width ascii strings put in keb elements in
  jmdict are in reb lements in jmnedict. 

  Need to think about how to fix this.

  In Edict list thread:
    2008-04-23: [edict-jmdict] jmnedict non-kanji keb elements
  JB said he'd changed mixed kana/FWascii ken element to reb elements
  in JMnedict.

  On the same issue in JMdict in:
    2008-04-26: [edict-jmdict] jmdict/jmnedict inconsistency
  his response was:
    "OK, I am now accepting full-width alphabetics as keb members."

  Wrote a quicky script to scan a jmdict file, and the find unicode
  character blocks(s) for the character sin the reb, keb, and gloss
  elements.  Results in moinmoin docs:

  Modified jdb.jstr_classify() to incorporate the definition JB
  suggested, and added three new functions, jstr_reb(), jstr_keb(),
  and jstr_gloss() since those determinations are  nor more complex
  than siple bit masking.

  Also modified lib/jmxml.py, lib/jellex.py, autocond() in lib/jdb.py,
  and progam exparse.py to use the new functions rather than 
  jstr_classify.

  Added tests for revised jdb.jstr_classify() function (IS-8).

  All the characers above except ～ (FF5E) are in the unicode code
  blocks, 3040..309F:Hiragana, 30A0..30FF:Katakana.  Emailed response
  to Jim's mail asking is making the rules to be those two blocks
  would be better.

  Updated jdb.jstr_classify() and jdb_jstr_reb() to use the rule 
  3040-30FF+FF5E and parsed latest jmdict, number of misclassifications 
  was wat down, but still a few rebs contained '＆', '、', '／', and 
  full-width alphanumerics.  Email the results to the list.

2009-02-28 13:24:00 stuart
  Jim Breen on the Edict mailing list says that the '〜' character
  in his email is not U+FF5E (FULLWIDTH TILDE) but rather what is
  currently in JMdict XML, U+301C (WAVE DASH), and gives, 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Mapping_to_legacy_character_sets 
  as the reason why.  Actually, the reference given there, 
    http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2166.doc
  was a little more informative for me, and my understanding is that
  the WAVE DASH character is in JIS X 208 and the FULLWIDTH TILDE is
  not (although it is in JIS X 213.)

  Updated jdb.jstr_classify() for this change.

2009-03-02 07:41 stuart
  Added reb/keb check to python/exparse.py and put and jp sentences that
  meet the new reb criteria in the reb (with a warning message) rather
  than blindly in the keb.  After a reload however, none met the criteria.

2009-03-09 10:15 stuart
  python/lib/jdb.py: Make functions jstr_reb(), jstr_keb(), jstr_gloss()
  return True is the parameter string has a liength of 0.
  Update the failing tests in python/tests/test_jdb_jstr_classify.py for
  the "reb" rules change described above.  All jstr_clasify tests pass now.
