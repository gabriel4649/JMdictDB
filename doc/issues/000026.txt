  jmdict.pm -- The database expects text strings in table "rdng" to
  contain no kanji chars and in table "kanj" to contain at least one.
  Function jstr_classify used to determine kana/kanji-ness.  However there
  are some jmdict items that have kanji text that are not considered kanji
  by jmdict::jstr_classify:
  1000060: 々
  1000090: ◎
  1000090: ×
  1085560: トライ＆エラー (is reading but search thinks it's kanji)
  Change jstr_classify?  Or do something else?
