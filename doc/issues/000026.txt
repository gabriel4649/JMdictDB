  jmdict.pm -- The database expects text strings in table "rdng" to
  contain no kanji chars and in table "kanj" to contain at least one.
  Function jstr_classify used to determine kana/kanji-ness.  However there
  are some jmdict items that have kanji text that are not considered kanji
  by jmdict::jstr_classify:
  1000060: 々
  1000090: ◎
  1000090: ×
  1085560: トライ＆エラー (is reading but search thinks it's kanji)
  Change jstr_classify?  Or do something else?

  Added check to jmparse.py that issues a warning to the log file if
  a <keb> element is processed that does not contain any kanji chars.
  When run on JMdict or JMnedict, a lot of such warnings occur, most
  due to failure of jdb.jstr_classify() to treat full-width equivalents
  of ascii characters as kanji.  In jdb.jstr_classify() changed the 
  unicode range defining "kanji" from 0x4E00-0x9FFF to 0x4E00-0xFFFF.
  However, the extended range is probably not right either as is 
  contains half-width katakana (FF61-FF9F) and the unicode surrogate
  range (D800-DFFF).

  There are similar warnings from JMnedict but in addition there are 
  a lot of kana-only <keb> texts.  See the following explanation by
  Jim Breen on the Edict mailing list:

  Will either wait for Jim to fix in JMnedict, or will have to try
  to detect and relocate during parsing.

  Perhaps we need some code from jstr_classify() that indicates
  characters that could be *either* kanji or kana?

  Just noticed that the above change fixes many "no kanji in keb"
  warnings when processing jmdict, it now causes many "no kana in 
  in "reb" warning when processing jmnedict!
  If seems that the full-width ascii strings put in keb elements in
  jmdict are in reb lements in jmnedict. 

  Need to think about how to fix this.

  In Edict list thread:
    2008-04-23: [edict-jmdict] jmnedict non-kanji keb elements
  JB said he'd changed mixed kana/FWascii ken element to reb elements
  in JMnedict.

  On the same issue in JMdict in:
    2008-04-26: [edict-jmdict] jmdict/jmnedict inconsistency
  his response was:
    "OK, I am now accepting full-width alphabetics as keb members."

  Wrote a quicky script to scan a jmdict file, and the find unicode
  character blocks(s) for the character sin the reb, keb, and gloss
  elements.  Results in moinmoin docs:

  Modified jdb.jstr_classify() to incorporate the definition JB
  suggested, and added three new functions, jstr_reb(), jstr_keb(),
  and jstr_gloss() since those determinations are  nor more complex
  than siple bit masking.

  Also modified lib/jmxml.py, lib/jellex.py, autocond() in lib/jdb.py,
  and progam exparse.py to use the new functions rather than 
  jstr_classify.

  Added tests for revised jdb.jstr_classify() function (IS-8).
