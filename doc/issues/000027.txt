  kwstatic.pm -- Provide way for caller to check name/version of database
  used.

  This is really three issues:
  1. What version of static data is loaded?
  2. What version of entry data is loaded?  (Addressed by dt field in
  kwsrc?)
  3. What version of the schema is in use?
  All are subject to inaccuracy due to changes made after db
  created/loaded.
