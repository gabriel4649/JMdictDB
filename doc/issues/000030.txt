  load_jmdict.pl -- Do other error checking (or could do these after data
  loaded into db): all senses have gloss?  All entries have sens and
  reading? ... (But remember that deleted entries have no sences or
  readings).

  Added duplicate kanji and reading text checks in jmparse.py.
  Added check that keb is kanji and reb is reading in jmparse.py.

  Closing this issue since the xml parser has been stable for quite a
