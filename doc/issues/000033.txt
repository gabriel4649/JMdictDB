  database -- write maintenance scripts to check for things that are hard
  to write contraints for: do all senses have at least one gloss?  do all
  (jmdict) entries have at least one sense and reading?, Are
  rdng,kanj,sens,gloss ord numbers consecutive?
  Does each set of src/seq entries have at most one active approved entry?

  It may be useful to duplicate some of the input checking requested in
  IS-168 on database entries in case any sneak in by other routes.

  Need a cron job to delete D and R entries after some period of time.

  JMdictDB being used for live updates by Jim Breen now, which means
  this issue is now much higher priority.
