  entr.pl -- If there is cross-ref and a reverse-ref to the same target in
  a sense, mark the cross-ref (with an astrisk or something) to indicate
  the existance of the reverse reference, rather that displaying the full
  reverese refernce which duplicates the text in the cross-ref and looks
  confusing.
