  srchres.pl -- Simplify build_search_table() and mk_from_clause().
  Because of the 2007-02-11 pk/fk change, we don't need join all the
  parent tables of the table we're looking at -- the search target table
  can be joined directly and soley to "entr" which should greatly simplify
  the code.

  Done.
