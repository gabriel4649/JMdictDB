  entr.tal, and probably others does not have very good control over
  whitespace.  For example, there is a space after the opening bracket of
  a FoU tag (e.g. ichi1)  but no space before the closing bracket.  If
  these templates get a life beyond development, need to go through them
  and fix whitespace.

  Elimination of unwanted whitespace can be done by breaking the lines in
  the html inside tags, ie
    <xxx>foo</xxx>
    <yyy>:</yyy>
  becomes
    <xxx>foo</xxx
    ><yyy>:</yyy>
  See the lsrc section of perl/lib/tal/entr.tal-1.12 for example.
