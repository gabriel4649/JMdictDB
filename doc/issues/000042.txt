  Would be better than tracking bugs here.

  Created a Microsoft Access database into which I put the per-file change
  log info that previously was entered into the Changes.txt file and the
  to-do items.  Both the Changes.txt and TODO.html files are now generated
  from the database data.  This is not adaquate for multiple contributors
  but is ok for now for me.
