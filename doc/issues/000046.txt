  Use a static include file for at least kw->id mapping.  Right now, I
  either use $::KW which requires a database connection (which might not
  otherwise be needed), or hardwire id numbers in the code which will be
  impossible to find if the id numbers ever change.

  Resolution:
  1. Change the kw table load data files from sql inserts, to csv format.
  This allows them to be easily read by other programs.
  2. Write perl/lib/mkkwmod.pl which will read the csv files and generate
  a perl module file (lib/kwstatic.pm).  The eliminates the need to
  extract the data from loaded database tables, something problematical in
  programs whose job is to load the database.
  3. Change loadkw.sql to load from csv file rather than sql inserts.
