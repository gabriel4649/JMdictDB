  Support loading multiple datasets into database... Make loading a file
  to database a two-step process. (1) parse file into intemediate format
  with rebaseable id numbers. (2) adjust the id numbers as needed while
  loading the intermediate file into tables.  This allows loading things
  like jmnedict and the examples file.
