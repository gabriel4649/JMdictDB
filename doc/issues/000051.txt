  mkviews.sql -- Flatten view dupentr.  Currently uses loops and processes
  an entry as a tree.  But with the pk/fk change of 2007-02-11, we can
  copy everthing needed by finding it using fk field "entr" and the other
  fields' values don't need changing, so all the looping no longer needed.

  Done.
