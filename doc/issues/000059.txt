  load_jmdict.pl -- Create skipped_comments log file some place other than
  current directory (or at lerast allow option) because it shouldn't be
  included in tar file when making a development snapshot.  Alternatively,
  automate snapshot creation and exclude skipped* file.
  
  Added a -l option to specify logfile location.  In Makefile, dist target
  exclude *.log files.
