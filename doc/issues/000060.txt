  perl -- Move lib to under cgi?  (This dir needs to be accessible to the
  cgi scripts when installed in a cgi directory, but should not be
  accessible via a web server url.  Putting under the cgi dir
  wouldaccomplish this (at least for Apache, not sure about IIS.))
  
  Don't do. Files in lib/ are used by perl/*.pl scripts as well as the cgi
  scripts, so moving it under cgi would be inappropriate.  Better way is
  to use standard Apache/IIS config options to deny access.
