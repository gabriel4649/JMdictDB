  entr.css -- move out of .cgi -- is inaccessible there on arakawa.
  Or better: read config file giving lib dirs, db info, etc.

  Resolution:
  Left in cgi/ in development environment but make Makefile will move to
  different directory at install time (and update the *.tal files to
  match.)
  Potential problem: some cgi's write their own html (to create error
  pages for example).  Currently these don't use any .css but if they did,
  they would need to adjust location depending on whether they are running
  from the development directory, or web server cgi directory.
