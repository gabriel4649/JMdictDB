  Maintaining the change log manually in a text file is not too bad, but
  the html to-do list is a bear do to the lack of a decent html editor.
  NVU: Haven't found good way to cut/paste table rows and it trashes any
  preexisting html source formatting.  Windows tools like Word or
  Frontpage write Microsoft flavored html.
  
  Will try to write MS Access app (since I know Access and can do fast).
  Since I am only one using it and only the results (change log and to-do
  list files) will go into the source code the proprietary nature of the
  tool is irrelevant.  This will change if/when other people contribute.
