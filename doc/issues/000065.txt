  Currently in entr.tal and nwconf.tal, a gloss tag (if any) is displayed
  in square brackets in front of the gloss number, e.g.:
  
    [lit.] 1. my gloss
  
  It would look better displayed after the gloss number:
  
    1. [lit.] my gloss
  
  or possibly at the end of the gloss:
  
    1. my gloss [lit.]
