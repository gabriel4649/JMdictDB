  The Examples file now marks some sentenses as exemplars for specific
  jmdict words, using a tilde (~) character at the end of the B line item
  for the word.  See email from Paul Blay posted to the edict-jmdict email
  list on 2007-06-01:

  Need to fix exparse,pl to recognise this new syntax and somehow
  represent this information in the xref records, which are what are used
  to represent the B line items.
