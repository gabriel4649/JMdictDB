  Current thinking is that the "trans" text found in about 500 glosses
  will become an lsrc attribute ("wasei") rather than a gloss attribute as
  I anticipated in the previous schema version.  This will be a boolean
  value.
  
  In previous schema version, lsrc attributes "full" and "part" (partial)
  were treated like other keywords and coded in table kwlsrc.  However
  subsequent discussion on the edict-jmdict email list has clarified that
  these are mutually exclusive, and can be represented by a single boolean
  value in table lsrc.
  
  See:

  Since the "part" and "wasei" values are independent, it is awkward to
  represent them by a single list of keywords as the schema provided for
  up to now.
  
  Change is to replace the kw column with two boolean columns in table
  lsrc, remove table kwlsrc, and adjust the code to match.

  Done.
