  Change id {97} created a near duplicate of jmdictcgi::resolv_xref() in
  module jmdict.  Need to change jmdictcgi to call the jmdict version
  rather than continuing to use its own local version.

  xresolv_xref() was removed from jmdictgci:: in chgid-145.  It was used
  only by obsolete new entry and edit entry form prior to adoptation of
  current jbparser ones.
