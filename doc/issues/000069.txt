  cgi scripts and other scripts (eg showentr.pl) use seq numbers to
  identify entries but seq numbers are ambiguous without the corpus id.
  Need to adopt a syntax that allows both seq number and corpus id
  (qqqqqqq.ss), and change current uses of seq number to support it.

  Changes made in:
  perl/cgi/srchform.pl (make the form pay attention to the Src checkbox
  selections when seq# given.)
  perl/cgi/edsubmit.pl
  perl/cgi/entr.pl
  perl/showentr.pl
