  In the JEL language parsed by jbparser, tags can be used in brackets
  without spectifying their type if they are not ambiguous.  Currently no
  check is made (parser uses first one found).  Need to fix this.
  - When parser is looking for a sense tag, it should not consider same
  tag in, say, KINF, to be ambiguous.
  - Parser should exclude obsolete tags (id>200) when considering
  ambiguity.
  - After taking above considerations into account, should return a "is
  ambiguous" code when tag is ambiguous.

  This is fixed in the Python version of the JEL parser.  It passes
  unresolved tags up to higher semantic levels in the parser where
  they are resolved with knowlage of what tag types are allowable at
  that level.

  Since the Perl version of the code is being abandoned, it will not
  be fixed there.
