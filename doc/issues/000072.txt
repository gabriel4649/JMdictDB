  In the JEL language parsed by jbparser, tags can be used in brackets
  without spectifying their type if they are not ambiguous.  Currently no
  check is made (parser uses first one found).  Need to fix this.
  - When parser is looking for a sense tag, it should not consider same
  tag in, say, KINF, to be ambiguous.
  - Parser should exclude obsolete tags (id>200) when considering
  ambiguity.
  - After taking above considerations into account, should return a "is
  ambiguous" code when tag is ambiguous.
