  In jmparse.pl, function extract_lit() uses the regex "/(lit:[^)]+)/ to
  extract the literal text.  But it appears that some such glosses contain
  parens as part of the lit text so the above pattern recognises it
  incorrectly.  For example, 2149180 (行ってまいります), has the gloss: "So long
  (lit:"(I'm) going and coming back")".
  
  Similar problem in 1029490 extracing lsrc (trans:) info from
  <gloss>foam rubber (trans: Eversoft (trademark))</gloss>
  (reported by JB).

  Since this is a temp hack until JB decides on an xml representation, it
  may not be worth spending much time on this.  Perhaps we could generate
  a warning and do manual fixup later since there probably aren't too many
  of these.
