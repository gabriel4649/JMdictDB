  Xrefs present in an edit submission (e.g. a "[see=...]" item in a sense)
  appear in the confirmation form but not in the new/edited entry created
  from the submission.

  Using debugger, noted that the entr structure created in edsubmit.pl has
  a erefs substrucure, but no xrefs records.  This seems likely the cause.
  
  This was fixed in the changes to xref handling made in changeset 23.
