  Entr rows currently use a surrogate primary key (auto-number int id
  column) but has not other way of uniquely identifying entries.  This is
  a problem when exporting/importing entries, or moving them between
  databases since there is no way to identify the target of inter-entry
  reference (xrefs for example) sinve the entry id may change on being
  reloaded.

  We can't use (src,seq) as a pk because multiple copies of the same entry
  can exist with different or the same stat values (e.g. there can be
  several "updated, approval pending" versins of the same entry).
  
  Option: add a version number (small int) field to entr, say 'entr', to
  distinguish between otherwise indistinguishable entries, and make unique
  key (src,seq,entr).  Don't really want it to be the PK becaue it will
  make children table PK's too long.
