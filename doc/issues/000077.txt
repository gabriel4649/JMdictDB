  Currently we use the hack of using values >200 is the kw* tables to
  indicate that the kw is obsolete.  Some programs print warning messages
  when they encounter such keywords.  This is a hack and needs to be fix
  by adding a boolean "obsol' column to the keyword tables.
  
  There are some other similar cases:
  kwmisc -- Uses 1xx value keywords for jmnedict tags.  I don't think any
  programs make use of that coding though.
  kwpos -- Uses 3xx value keywords for extra PoS types used by
  experimental verb inflection stuff.

  Code contains hardwired kw values:
  --
  dbcheck tool hardwires entr.src values.
  web/cgi/srchres.py: has a fixme for "e.src!=4".
  web/cgi/srchform.py: filters kanjidic by name, rinf by <100.
