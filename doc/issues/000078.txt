  In all the UI's and doc, change references to "src" (from "entry
  source") to "corp" (for "corpus").  Reason is that when adding a new
  entry to an existing "src" like JMdict, it seems odd to think of the new
  entry's "source" as jmdict -- since it is new it is not in the jmdict
  entries yet so how can jmdict be its "source"?  Calling it a corpus
  seems more accurate.
  
  May also want to change code variable names and database identifiers
  (columns, tables, etc.)
  
  Also, the table kwsrc is not really a "kw*" table any more: columns
  are different and data is no longer static.  Should rename it to
  "corpus"
  or something.
