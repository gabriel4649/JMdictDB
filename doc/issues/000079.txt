  Although the most time consuming part of the load proces (downloading
  the files, parsing them, and rebasing the id numbers) are down without
  touching any existing active jmdict database, loading the data into
  Postgresql is done on the active "jmdict" databaseand takes from about
  1.5 minutes on Arakawa for just the jmdict xml file, to 30+ minutes on
  my slow machines for the full (jmdict,jmnedict,examples) set.
  
  To minimize impact to other users, might be better to loading into a
  database other than"jmdict", and after the load is successful, rename or
  drop the old jmdict db, and rename the new one to "jmdict".
  
  I think this is a ./Makefile change along with changing any hardwired
  "jmdict" database names used in the pg/*.sql files.

  Makefile and pg/reload.sql now load into database "jmnew".  New makefile
  target, "activate", moves "jmnew" database to "jmdict" after it has been
  determined to be viable.
