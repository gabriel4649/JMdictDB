  Actually 粛白 is a reverse reference.  Both the forward xrefs are missing.

  Will wait until the completion of taskid-80 ("Ordered xrefs") since the
  changes made for that could fix or expose the cause of this problem.
  
  After taskid-82, the missing xrefs now appear in showentr.pl and entr.pl
  web page output.  Don't know why they were missing before.  Note that
  the process that resolves the xrefs is hueristic and may not resolve
  everything correctly.
  
  There are still 6 known entries with unresolved xrefs because the
  resolver could not identify a unique target.  Documented in 2007/07/29
  email to Jim Breen.
