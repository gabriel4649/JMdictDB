  The following text (which occurs in one of my mnn17 flash card entries)
  causes a jbparser parse error when included in the "reading" section of
  an edit submission:
    ［おふろに］はいります
  Problem seems to be the brackets which are classified as kanji
  characters and thus make the whole string a kanji string and illegal in
  the reading section.
