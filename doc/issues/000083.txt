  The following text (which occurs in one of my mnn17 flash card entries)
  causes a jelparse parse error when included in the "reading" section of
  an edit submission:
    ［おふろに］はいります
  Problem seems to be the brackets which are classified as kanji
  characters and thus make the whole string a kanji string and illegal in
  the reading section.

  See also task-26: "Kana-kanji determination".

  Jwb adopted specific rule for <reb> and <keb> content, see IS-26.
  However that does not help this issue because we need to be able
  to handle entries that violate them, the flash card entry noted
  above for example.

  Modified jelparse to require that the kanji part of an entry 
  go entirely in the first lines, the reading part entirely in
  the second line, and the senses in the third and successive lines.
  That is, fomerly jelparse accepted KANJI<ws>READINGS<ws>SENSES
  (where <ws> is whitespace) but now reuires NEWLINES ('\n') in 
  place of <ws>.  This allows the parser to distinguish kanji and 
  readings by line position rather than character content.

  Modified python/lib/fmtjel.py to generate jel fmt text accordingly.
  Modified the test_jelparse tests (mainly the input and expected
  output data files) accordingly.  Some tests that previously passed
  (e.g, all input text in a single line) now pass by expecting a
  SyntaxError.  Changed web/cgi/edform.py to combine the kanji, reading,
  and sense text box strings accordingly.
