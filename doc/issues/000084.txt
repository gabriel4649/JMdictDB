  Makefile version 1.20 started failing on gunzip command in the
  jmdict.xml section.  Get message about file not found (not sure what
  file but message implies problem has to do with space character in path
  name.)  In Makefile-1.21 I changed the gunzip command to "sh gunzip ..."
  which fixes problem on Windows but breaks on unix.

  Problem was Windows Cygwin gunzip is now a shell script that runs as
  gunzip ok in cygwin shell, but requires explicit sh invocation when run
  in Windows outside of Cygwin shell.  However on Unix machines "sh gunzip
  ..." fails because gunzip is an executable, not a shell script.
