  Currently word summary lists that use view "esum" or similar (as occur
  in the search results page or the xref lists), show all the kanji and
  all the readings for the word.  Want to change so that only the first
  reading and or first kanji are shown.  This will make the summary line
  more concise and is consistent with jmdict's use of kanji/reading pairs
  to identify entries is xrefs.
