  table xresolv is used to hold the raw xrefs from files jmdict and
  examples (and others in future) as the xrefs are read, since they cannot
  be resolved immediately.  The table should be able to, and currently
  does, hold xrefs from various files simultaneously.  But the only thing
  that distinguishes xrefs from different files currently is the 'typ'
  field (2 or 3 from jmdict, 5 for Examples).  [preceding statement not
  true, see note.]
  
  Need to add new column 'src' to xresolv, and modify jmparse.pl,
  exparse.pl, and their modules to provide value for it.

  Having second thoughts about this.  The table does have column 'entr'
  that allows joining to table entr to get the src.  While a minor pain,
  it is better than breaking normaiization(?)  OTOH, this table is not
  part of the core schema, and contents are intended to be temporary, so
  perhaps it doesn't matter if we break normalization?  Lowered prio to
  low.
  
  Decided not to do.
