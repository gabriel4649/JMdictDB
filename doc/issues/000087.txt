  jmdict.xml (as of a week or so ago?), started denoting some xref targets
  with the syntax KK.RRR.ss in the xref elements, where KK is a kanji
  string, RRR a kana string, and ss a (optional) number indicating a
  specific sense.  The ".s are actually a u\30fb. KK or RRR may be missing
  (but not both of course.)
  
  Note that some jmdict entries have embedded \u30fb characters in their
  kanji and/or reading text, and will need to be taken account of.
  Currently they are of the forms KKK.KKK, RRR.RRR, RRR.KKK, and no
  KKK.RRR so at present there in no ambiguity.
  
  Will also need to redo xresolv.sql (creates xrefs from the parsed xml
  data) which currently assumes kanji or reading but not both, and no
  sense info.

  Done.
