  When running the master2.pl script from Jim, noticed that memory usage
  grew continuously during execution.  The code was written to process
  entries in blocks of 100 to avoid this problem.  Need to find the source
  of this, particularly if it is due to EntrList() objects not getting
  garbage-collected.

  Problem traced to the use of DBI method prepare_cached() in
  jmdict::dbread().  Apparently DBI does not limit the cache size.
  Changed method call to prepare() and memory use is flat.
