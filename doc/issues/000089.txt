  The way we currently generate xrefs from the xresolv data makes it
  impossible to definatively identify the xresolv row from which an xref
  row was generated.  The reason is that xref are numbered (in column
  "xref") dynamically as they are order, xresolv rows are ordered
  sequentially but because the one xresolv row can result in several xref
  rows (if the target entry has multiple senses) there is not a one-one
  corespondence between the numbers.

  Create new table xrefld.  Xrefs generation now goes: xresolv -> _xrsv
   -> xrefld -> xref.  xrefld has columns entr,sens,xref,ord.
  entr,sens,xref form a fk to the xref table.  entr,sens,ord form a fk to
  the xresolv table.  Thus xrefld serves to link the two tables. Another
  benefit is the the trigger that assigns "xref" column values is now on
  table xrefld, rather than table xref.
