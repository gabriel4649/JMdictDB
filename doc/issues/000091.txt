  Doing a "starts" text search (srchform.pl, search code in srchres.pl) is
  very slow (typ 25s on my development machine) because postgresql does
  sequential scan and does not use index.  Need to see if we can convince
  it to use index.
  
  See also taskid-35.

  Chg-207 adds varchar_pattern_ops indexes to kanj, rdng tables. Not sure
  if it actually helps.
