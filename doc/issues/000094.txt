  jmdict::EntrList() is the primary (and only) API function that will
  extract all the information relevant to a set entries from the database,
  and from it build runtime objects representing those entries.  The only
  way to tell it what entries to operate on is to give it the name of a
  previously contructed table containing the entr.id values.  Constructing
  a table and loading it seems like excessive overhead in common simple
  cases when one want just a few entries that are easily specified in sql.
  
  EntrList() needs to allow alternate arguments such as an arbitrary sql
  statement or list of entry id's.

  Extracted the data retrieval part of EntrList() into entr_data() and the
  object building part into entr_bld().  EntrList() now just a wrapper
  that calls these two functions.
  
  Rewrote entr_data() so that it accepts a sql statement, a list of id
  numbers or a Tmptbl object (as before).  If also can use the input arg
  either in a IN() clause or in a JOIN.
