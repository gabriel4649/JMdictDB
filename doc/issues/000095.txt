  Currently, when xref is displayed, the target entry is shown using it's
  reading and kanji headwords (i.e. its first reading and/or kanji).  Jim
  Breen points out (email, 2007-08-10) when displaying xrefs, there is
  sometimes a need to display other than the headword.  Example he gives
  is an xref to 1348350/小人[しょうにん](2)/dwarf/, which one would want to
  display as 小人[こびと].

  Need to include the display reading/kanji in each xref row. Two options:
  1. Store the rdng/kanj text in each xref.
  2. Store the rdng number / kanj number in each xref.
  Think (2) is better because it provides higher data integrity (prevents
  storing completely unrelated/erroneous xref text).
