  The restr, stagr, and stagk tables can be consolidated into a single
  table with columns (entr,rdng,kanj,sens).

  Issues to be worked out
  - What are the rules for conversion from restr/stagr/stagk into the
  unified form? (Do conflicts exist in jmdict xml?  What are the rules for
  resolving them?)
  - How to convert back to the restr/stagr/stagk form for display, xml,
  etc.
  - Can back conversion exactly reconstruct the original
  restr/stagr/stagk?
