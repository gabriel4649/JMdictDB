  When an entry having restr restrictions is edited and submitted, the
  edconf page dies when it tries to display restr txt not present in the
  entry object.  Example is seq# 1250500.  Got to edit page and sumbit
  without making any changes.  Petal rendering fails complaining it can't
  access z/txt.
  
  Also noted that in edconf.pl, that restr lists are linked only to rdng
  items, not to kanj items.
