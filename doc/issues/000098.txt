  jmdict::Dbopen() reads a config file to find out the database and db
  credentials to use.  To change database (to use development version
  rather than production version for example) requires changing the file.
  Intead we could have the config file have multiple lines representing
  different databases and give dbopen() a parameter that selects one.

  Planned to modify jmdict.cfg syntax for multiple lines representing
  different databases.  But Postgresql's "services" already support this.
  See:
  [Both the following are in Postgresql Docs, libpq api...]
   + 29.1. Database Connection Control Functions
   + 29.14. The Connection Service File
  [In the Perl modules doc...]
   + DBD-Pg / DBI Class Methods / connect() method
  No point inventing a new file format that does the same thing as
  Postgresql already does.  Instead, modified dbopen() to use a Postgresql
  services ile. Modified all the cgi scripts and tal templates to accept
  and propagate the service name.
