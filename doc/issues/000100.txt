  When a tag that was used in JMdict.xml in the past is no longer used, I
  change it's id number to >200 which will generate a warning when
  encountered when parsing jmdict.
  
  Originally this was so that the parse wouldn't die when the tag was
  encountered (when parsing an old file, or when it reappears in a new
  file as sometimes happens).  But these days jmparse doesn't die on
  unrecognised tags so why not just delete them?

  Done.
