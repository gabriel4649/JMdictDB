  Since kanji.reading pair is not sufficient to uniquely indentify a
  target entry, need to be able to give an entry seq#(/src#?).  Currently
  the jel parser ha no syntax to support this.

  This works as of rev 2ca1e8193b3a.  Syntax is:

    SEQ corpus・KANJI・READING[snums]
    ENTRNUM#・KANJI・READING[snums]

  where

    SEQ -- Target sequence number.  Optional if KANJI/READING is
  sufficient to uniquely identify target.

    corpus -- The corpus in which to look for SEQ.  If not given
  the corpus is the same as the xref source entry.

    ENTRNUM -- A number followed by a "#" character is taken as an
  entry id number.

    KANJI・READING -- If SEQ not given, this will be used to find target
  Whether ort not SEQ is given, his will be used to set xref's 'kanj' 
  and 'rdng' fields.  Only one of KANJI or READING may be given if that 
  is sufficient to uniquely locate the target entry.

    snums -- Target sense number or ciomma separated list of target sense
  numbers.

  Possible to-do:  Get rid the ENTRNUM# form?  Are there any cases where 
  we *do not* want all entries of the same SEQ number referenced?
