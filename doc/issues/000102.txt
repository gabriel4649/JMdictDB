  After the postgres "service" login change (2007/08/23 0:21, changeset
  42) cgi pages are failing on my Fedora linux machine.  Message in httpd
  error log include text:
  > DBI connect('service=jmdict','',...) failed: FATAL:
  >   password authentication failed for user "postgres"...
  Double checked username, password, etc, all are correct.

  Problem was the pg_service.conf file was in dos format (had "\r\n" line
  endings).  Converting it to unix ("\n" line endings) with the semi-
  standard "dos2unix" tool fixed problem.
