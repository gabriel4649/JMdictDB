  kwsrc is not really a kw* table -- it has different columns that the
  other kw* tables and more importantly, does not really contain static
  data.  OTOH, it is like a kw table in that apps frequently need to use
  its information based on a kwsrc.id value.
  I propose the following changes should be made:
  2. Do not load static data into it when loadkw.sql is run.
  3. Modify code that loads data (jmparse.pl, exparse.pl) to accept
  arguments that define the corpus info, and create corpus record as part
  of generating the other data.
  4. Continue to have jmdict::Kwds include a {SRC} sub-hash.

  - Removed kwsrc from kwstatic.pm.
  - Can't removed from code that builds or uses $::KW -- many display
  functions need to be able to lookup corpus abbr by id.
  - Added command line syntax to jmparse.pl, exparse.pl for user to give
  corpus record info but: id,kw only.  No descr.  seq value hardwired in
  code dependent on kw.
