  Would be nice if the submitter of an entry or change could retract it.
  This requires some way of verifying that the requester of the retraction
  is the same as the original submitter.  (Suggested by Paul Blay.)

  jwb received a similar request from Hi Huixing and cc'd me on the
  reply, suggesting this could be accomlished by setting a short term
  cookie.  We would need to check and verify that no other user had 
  submitted an edit to the original entry but other than that, it should
  be straight forward to do.
