  On the cgi searchform (web/cgi/srchform.cgi, perl/lib/tal/srchform.tal)
  the corpus items checked by default jmdict, and any additionally added
  corpuses, but not jmnedict, examples, or test.
  
  This is desirable, but accidental.  The first digit of all the checked
  items is 1 (the added corpus items were all given 1xx id numbers) and
  the PETAL "decode" function used in the .tal template file apperently
  only looks at the id number's first digit when determining it result
  (which determines whether the corresponding checkbox is checked or not).

  Switching code base to Python so don't plan to fix this.
