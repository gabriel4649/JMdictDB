  Some preliminary work shows that Python cgi scripts run
  about 2-3x faster than the current Perl scripts.  Several
  of the API's were converted to Python for the principle
  developer's personal use and these contain a number of
  bug fixes and design enhancements that would need to be
  back ported to Perl.

  All code was converted to Python, commited to the jmdictdb
  repo in (the very large) changeset d2d88d6053d7.  Code was
  installed on Arakawa and seems ok.  At this point there are
  no dependencies on Perl at all and the Perl code will be
  removed very soon.

  Forgot to convert tools/mkindex.pl to Python.  That was done 
  in changeset 8607e0989b8a.

  Removed all perl code, which comletes this issue.
