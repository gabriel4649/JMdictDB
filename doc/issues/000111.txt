  web/cgi/srchform.pl is supposed to have only the corpus
  check box with src id 1 (typically "jmdict") selected by
  default.  However it will select and corpus with a src
  id whose string representation starts with "1", e.g. 10-19
  or 100-199.  I think problem is in Petal "decode" function
  used in perl/lib/tal/srchform.tal.
  
  This idsa very low priority issue since the reimplementation
  in Python is nearly complete and I don't want to spend time
  on the soon-to-be-obsolete Perl stuff.
