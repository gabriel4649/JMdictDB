  While working on three-letter language code support for parsing
  jmdict xml, noted a number of places in the Perl libs where
  language support is lacking:
  
  * Function jel_sens() in perl/lib/jmdictfmt.pm formats glosses
  in JEL format but ignores the gloss' "lang" attribute.
  
  * perl/lib/jbparse.yp
  No syntax for specifying a non-english gloss language.  Can try
  [equ=fre:contraire]" but that is a syntax error because there is
  no gloss text outside the tag brackets.
  
  * perl/lib/jbparse.yp
  Possible confusion or shadowing between "lit" (gloss GINF tag) and
  "lit" language ("Lithuanian").  There is no "equ" language in either
  iso-639-2 or -3, so no confusion there.
  
  (Aside: this is a problem independent of language that also affects
  intended syntax like "[lit:xxxxxx]" which also doesn't work.)

  Change to Python as the implementation language (IS-109) makes this 
  issue moot.
