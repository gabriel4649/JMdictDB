  Want to move project from CVS to a DVCS.  Driving factors are:
  * Ability to replicate repos will allow a full, publicly accessible
    repo to live on Arakawa, rather than just sporatically updated
    snapshot files.
  * I will be able to maintain a local remote repo supporting my
    development work and push changes to Arakawa.
  * Will noy need to maintain a static IP address at home solely
    to make may CVS server accessible to Arakawa.
  
  Selected Mercurial because:
  * git has poor windows support.
  * bzr does not currently support multi-platform (unix/windows
    development) since it lacks the ability to manage text file
    line endings.
  * monotone is written in haskell which would make writing extensions
    difficult (for me; Mercurial (and bzr) written in Python).
  * Other options (darcs, etc) seem to be insufficiently mature.

  Plan:
  1. Install Mercurial on Windows and Linux development machines [done]
  2. Import jmdictdb project from CVS into Mercurial repo. [done]
  3. Set up a central repo with full public read access, write access
     limited to a few developers, accessible via http.
  4. Things that need updating:
        Project page on Arakawa: update the download instructions (be
          sure to note that files will have unix eol's need conversion
          for windows.)
        README.txt -- revise download and install instructions
          may want to add note about configuring mercurial (extensions
          needed etc?)  Note need for Mercurial keyword expansion else
          scripts will fail when run.)
        What to do about doc/MANIFEST.txt, doc/CHANGES.txt (since this
          info come from Mercurial now rather than the old Chglog MS
          Access database?)
  5. Ask William Maton to install Mercurial on Arakawa [done.]
