  Up to April, 2008 issue tracking was done using a small, custom
  Microsoft Access database application was used to track bugs,
  feature requessts, to-do, and other such issues.  It was also
  used to maintain a detailed change log file.
  However with the change over to Mercurial, the change log comes
  from Mercurial, and the Access app is not suitable for use in a
  distributed environment.
  
  Will try using a set of text files, revision controlled as part
  of the project, for issue tracking.  This is supplemented with
  some simple tools to manage them.  Mercurial will provide change
  auditing and conflict merging for free, so tools don't have to
  worry about it.

  Wrote a python lib with basic classes to read/write/validate issue
  files, and some basic tools based on it: a script to export tasks
  from the Access database into issue files, an interactive shell
  to allow basic listing, searching, editing of issues, a script to
  generate an html "to-do" list like what was generated from the
  Access database.  These tools are a separate project and not
  included in the jmdictdb repo.
  
  Added all the issue files (in doc/issues) to the mercurial repo.

  Have been using this successfully so will consider this done
  within the jmdictdb project.  The tools still need a lot of work
  before they are ready for public use but I will do that in the
  context of an independent project.
