  Have added experimental support for loading kanjidic2 files
  but it presents some UI issues:
  * Do we want kanjidic to be option in corpus selection on
    search page.  (Probably not -- kanji search likely needs
    its own search form.)
  * When executing searches we need to filter kanjidic results
    out when building search criteria.
  * It uses some unique RINF values -- do we want these to be
    shown on the general search form (web/cgi/srchform.py)?
    If kanjidic not available in the corpus selections, then
    definately "no".  And definately "no" for pages used for
    the wwwjdic submission system.)
  * All the above require knowing which corpuses are kanjidic.
    Don't want to hardwire magic id's or keywords.  Add column
    to kwsrc table?
  * What about corpus dropdown list on edit page?  Should edconf.py
    (and edsubmit.py) pages refuse to accept entries wiyj kanjidic
    corpus?
  
  * entr page probably ok as is since its driven by entr.id
  * shentr.py util probably ok since that in internal tool and
    should allow display of kanji entries is desired.
  
  We'll need a dedicated kanjidic search, results pages but will
  open separate issue for that -- this issue is about how to
  load kanjidic into database and not create UI confusion for
  uses of current pages.

  As a temp measure will assume kanjidic corpus is always id=4.
  * Modified web/cgi/srchform.py to filter kanjidic corpus out
    of corpus list and kanjidic-specific rinf values out of rinf
    list.
  * Modified srchres.py to always add a "entr.src!=4" condition
    when building search criteria.
