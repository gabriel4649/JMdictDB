    From: Jim Breen

  Added to pg/data/kwmisc.csv:
  27	on-mim	onomatopoeic or mimetic word

  Also updated perl/lib/jmdictxml.pm.
  Ran "make" in perl/lib/ to rebuild kwstatic.pm.

  Note: the above referenced email also refers to the "ling" (FLD) 
  tag but that tag in already present in kwfld.csv so no further
  action needed.
