  As noted in IS-26 (note 2008-04-25 17:01:00) there were a lot of 
  entries in JMnedict with kana <keb> elements.  In edict mail list
  message:

  Jim Breen indicated his intention to move such text to reb elements
  with a RINF tag.  

  It seems this has already happened and the tag used is:  

    &ok; -- "old or irregular kana form"

  There already is an "ok" RINF tag (out-dated or obsolete kana usage")
  used in jmdict so I used:

    21	oik	old or irregular kana form

  in pg/data/kwrinf.csv for the new jmnedict keyword.  Also updated 
  perl/lib/jmdictxml.pm.  Ran "make" in perl/lib/ to rebuild kwstatic.pm.

  Jim Breen said he would change the "ok" entity string in jmnedict  
  to "oik".  Updated perl/lib/jmdictxml.pm.
