  jelparser.py uses Ply (http://dabeaz.com/ply) to parse
  new and edited entries described in JEL (Jmdict Edit
  Language).  When the ply code runs, it creates cache
  files that contain the generated parser tables.  These
  files are reused the next time the ply code needs to do
  a parse saving the considerable time it takes to generate
  them.  Unfortunately they are created in the current
  directory, whereever that may be.  This creates two
  problems:
  
  * When program runs in a different directory, it inccurs
    avoidable cost of regenerating the cache files.
  * The files are annoying "droppings" and can create un-
    wanted noise when using a version control system.
  
  Need to figure out how to tell Ply to create them in
  some fixed, out-of-the-way place.
  The files are parsetab.py and .pyc.

  This was done in changeset e103bcff8f6a 2009-02-02 by 
  writing a script to generate the parsetab file (tools/
  gen_parsetab.py), and doing that in the python/lib/Makefile.
  The parsetab file is now named python/lib/jelparse_tab.py
  and is managed under Mercurial.  The main Makefile "web"
  target copies it to the cgi lib directory.  All of this 
  together should prevent Ply from needing to regenerate it
  at runtime.
