  Currently, the jmnedict tags (surname, place, unclass, company,
  product, masc, fem, person, given, station) are POS tags, but
  they really should be changed to MISC tags.  'fem' should map 
  to preexisting MISC.fem tag.  Also consider mapping 'masc' to 
  MISC.male.

  jmparser.Roundtrip test failing on jmdict entry 1000520 because 
  that entry has a MISC 'fem' tag and it turns out there are 'fem'
  tags in both MISC and POS, causing the tag lookup in the parser 
  to declare it ambiguous.  The POS 'fem' tag is from the JMnedict
  entities.  (For men, MISC uses 'male' and JMnedict/POS uses 'masc'.)

  Since jmdictdb tags were made independent of jmdict in anticipation 
  of problems like this, should we map the jmnedict 'masc' tag to
  MISC.male?

  Raised the priority of this issue.

  Created new module xmlkw.py that contains a single function that
  will generate a new jdb.Kwds object, given an existing initialized
  (presumably from csv files or database) one.  The new one is 
  modified so the kw strings match the entities used in JM/ne/dict
  where usage differs.  Currently that is:
	jmnedict 'masc' entity mapped to MISC 'male'.
  In the standard Kwds csv data, changed the description on MISC 'male'
  and 'fem' to indicate they can also mark names.

  Moved the JMnedict keywords from pg/data/pos.csv to misc.csv but
  deleted 
    186    masc    male given name or forename
    187    fem     female given name or forename
  since 'fem already exists in misc.csv, and we will map jmnedict 
  entity 'masc' to misc 'male' using xmlkw.make().

  python/jmparse.py, python/lib/fmtxml.py, python/lib/jmxml.py were
  modified to set XKW from xmlkw.make() rather than KW.
