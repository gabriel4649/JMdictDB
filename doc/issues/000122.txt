  Think it would be good idea to create an initial corpus
  entry named "test" in kwsrc when schema is initially
  loaded by pg/reload.sql.  This will allow new entries
  to be added (by the cgi new entry page for example) even
  when no other corpus has been loaded.
  
  Need to add row to kwsrc table dynamically (since there
  is no og/dasta/kwsrc.csv file)?  Note that sequence "seq_test"
  is already created in pg/mktables.sql.
