  Currently we use JSON to serialize entries for shipping
  between the edconf and edsubmit web pages.  Because JSON
  has no means of representing items with multiple or cyclic
  refernces (entry objects can have at multiply referenced
  sub-objects, but don't think there are any cycles), the
  serializing code has to transform the object to a coded
  form that that captures the muliple references and represents
  them without multiple references but allows the reconstruction
  of those refernces at the receiving end.
  
  I believe that YAML suppports multiple references directly
  and may allow simplification of the entry serialization code.

  There *are* reference cycles in the restriction lists _restr,
  _stagr, _stagk, and in _freq.  See IS-28 2008-05-03.

  This post contains information on yaml's (in)security:
    http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2004-September/283010.html
  However, it was written in 2004, refers to the first PyYAML
  implementation (not the current completely rewritten version), 
  and the PyYAML doc notes that yaml.load() is insecure as it can 
  create arbitrary python objects (and offers a yaml.safe_load()).
