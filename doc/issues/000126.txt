  Jim Breen said he thought that the ordering of the various 
  JMdict XML tags (pos. misc, k_inf, etc) was significant.
  Need to consider how to preserve this order within the 
  database.  Preserving it will also simplify the entry 
  validation task of IS-10.

  In a response to my email question about whether the order
  of tags (pos, misc, kinf, etc) is significant, Jim Breen

  Maintaining the order of the re_pri and ke_pri elements in the 
  database is problematical because reading and kanji pri's are 
  combined into single "freq" table rows.  It is also not at all
  clear to me what information the ordering conveys.

  For k_inf, r_inf, pos, misc, field, dial, and lsource, in some 
  cases it also not clear what the order conveys (what is difference 
  in meaning between an entry with:
     <misc>&uk;</misc>
     <misc>&vulg;</misc>
  and one with:
     <misc>&vulg;</misc>
     <misc>&uk;</misc>
  ?) but in many cases a meaning based on commoness of use could
  be justified.  (If such a meaning is assigned, the obvious question
  how many entries have a "correct" order, i.e. have been checked?)
  In any event, the tags clearly mix information from different 
  domains so it's hard to justify not adding ordering on relational
  design grounds.

  Added support for ordered k_inf, r_inf, pos, misc, field, dial, 
  and lsource tags.
