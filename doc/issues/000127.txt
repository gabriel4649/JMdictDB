  Adjust the existing code in fmtxml.py and jmxml.py for the syntax
  J.B. chose for the ls_wasei attribute.

  No more need for ability to parse out the "(trans: ...)" text 
  from glosses since JMdict after 2008-05-06 or so has these 
  already extracted to lsource elements.  Note that the -y option 
  in jmparse.py is still needed for controlling the extraction of
  literal glosses.

  Also improved the formatting of the lsource information in the 
  entr.tal template (and its near twin edconf.tal).
