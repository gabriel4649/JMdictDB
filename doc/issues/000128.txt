  Recent revision better supports audio clips (new sound tables
  in schema, DTD extended to allow audio representation; fmt.py,
  fmtxml.py, jmxml.py, and various tools updated to handle clip
  id's) but there is still a lot to finish up.
  
  Still to do:
  Update documentation (schema.odt) for new sound tables.
  Update JEL Parser (jelparse.y) and formatter (fmtjel.py).
    (until those support audio clips, can't preserve audio
    data through an entry edit.)
  Show audio clip id's in entry template. (??) (Maybe should
    wait until we have have the page actually serve the sounrd
    to the client browser?)
  Add a "play" button the the html entry display page that serves
    the audio to client browser.
  Add a play button to srch.py results form.
  Create sound tools.  Plan to use Audacity to do clip segmentation
    but will need something to take an Audacity label track, match
    to entries, and load into database.
  audio.py only works on Windows, port to *nix.
  Add some means of playing audio to shentry.py.

  Item "Show audio clip id's in entry template" above was done in
  changeset e3b3244ded86 (2008-10-29).

  To do: 

  * pg/mkviews.sql: dupentr function still refers to obsolete
  table 'audio' rather than replacement tables 'rdngsnd' and 'entrsnd'.

  * entr.cgi: snd preparation is only done on entr._snd, not 
  _rdng[*]._snd.

  * jdb,augment_snd adds clip info but how to get file, dir info?

  * fmt.py (and toolsthat use it like shentr.py) displays only the
  clip id number when lising audio clips.
