  Want to add support for kanjidic2 data since the current
  schema can support it with relatively few additions.
  The earlier Perl version on jmdict included support and 
  some of this has been migrated to Python, the chr, cinf,
  and kwcinf database tables, kdparser, makefile rules.  
  Still to do:

  1. Fix kdparser.py (has syntax errors) [done]
  2. Update kdparser.py for jplt tags (see IS-116). [done]
  3. Update lib/fmt.py, shentr.py to show kanjidic entries. 
      [done]
  4. Suppress display of kanjidic entries in current web
      interface.  See also IS-115. [done]
  5. Create new web pages for kanji search and display, 
      see IS-115.
  6. Update dtd-jmdict-ex.xml, fmtxml.py, jmxml.py, to support
       kanjidic entries?
  7.? In chr table, change name of column "bushu" to "radical".
  8.? Add a second "radical" column for nelson_c values.
  9.? Add a "stroke" table for all stroke counts including 
       miscounts, remove "strokes" column from table chr.
  10. Port kresolv.pl to Python (creates xrefs from the variant
       info saved in the kresolv table by kdparse.py.)
  11. Find source for radical character and create radical 
       table. [done]
  12. Also tables for the data in JB's kradfile and radkfile.
