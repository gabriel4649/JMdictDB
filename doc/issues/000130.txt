  fmtxml.py currently does not generate a "xml:lang="eng""
  attributes in lsource elements as that is the default.
  However JMdict does generate such attributes when there
  are two lsource attributes in the same sense.  Need to
  do the same thing in fmtxml.py to improve compatiblity
  with JMdict.

  An email exchange on the edict list around 2008-05-05 led
  me to believe that in the JMdict XML, lsource attributes
  with lang="eng" would be changed to not specify the lang 
  attribute since "eng" was the default.  But current JMdict
  XML still has a dozen or so lsource elements with explicit
  "eng" lang attributes.  Further examination and edict list
  discussion (2008-06-17) indicates that those elements were
  occur in pairs with a non-english lsource that indicates the
  source of the gairaigo is disputed, and JB's XML generator 
  makes it difficult to remove the attribute in this condition.

  Need to change fmtxml.py to reverse the logic and generate
  and explicit 'xml:lang="eng"' attribute if the lsource does
  not have a "wasei" flag.

  Done in the co-commited version of python/lib/fmtxml.py.
