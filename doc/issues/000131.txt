  Need to implement the "default POS" rule in fmtxml.py.
  The rule says that if the POSes in a sense are the same
  (number, values, and order) as the preceeding sense, they
  should be omitted.  This will allow more congruence between
  JMdict and XML generated from the database.

  In an email exchange on the edict list around 2008-06-11 
  (subject: pos/misc entities), I pointed out that JMdict
  was inconsistent in that in most entries with multiple 
  senses, if the POS tags were the same as in the preceeding
  sense, they were left out.  In a few senses however they
  are explicitly given again in the following sense.
  This makes it difficult to regenerate the xml exactly 
  because there is no way to know when they should be given
  explicitly and when they should be implied.
  
  I provided reasons why I thought they should always be 
  given explicitly in the XML, but JB wants to keep the 
  default rule and implied POSes.  No clarity yet on whether
  the existing explicit (but should be implied) POSes will 
  be corrected though there was support for that from 
  Jean-Luc Leger.

  Done in the co-commited version of python/lib/fmtxml.py.
