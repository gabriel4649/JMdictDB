  The JEL grammer (in jelparser.y) uses a slash character to
  separate kanji and reading (and optionally seqid) in xref 
  and antonym text.  For example:

    [see=彼／あれ]

  JMdict uses XML for this:

    <xref>彼・あれ</xref>

  To reduce differences between JMdict syntax and JEL syntax, 
  it would be nice if JEL can also use a middle-dot character.

  Changed jelex.py and jelparse.y to use middle-dot rather
  than slash in xrefs.  (Also updated docs in lib/tmpl/edhelp.tal.)

  This introduces a new problem: middle-dots are used in some 
  rdng and kanj texts and consequently in restr text, (e.g.:

    Entry: jmdict 2038530 A {98679}
    Kanji: 1.原子力安全・保安院 2.原子力安全保安院
    Reading: 1.げんしりょくあんぜんほあんいん(原子力安全保安院) 
             2.げんしりょくあんぜん・ほあんいん(原子力安全・保安院)
    1. [n]
      1. Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency

  Restr text is parsed like xref text (as "jitem" in the parser)
  and dotted text like R.R or K.K will cause a parse error (only
  K.R is allowed).  Simply allowing those combination is insufficient
  since there exist entries like R.R.R so presumably K.K.K is also
  possible or existent, and so is a restr (or stagr, or stagk) 
  referencing it. 
  
  Options are to return to using slash in jitems, or parse xref
  and restr separately (or something else?)
