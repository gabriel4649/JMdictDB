  Under Windows both stdout and stderr from cgi scripts is
  sent to the client browser.
  
  jelparse.py (auto generated from jelparse.y), and the ply
  parser it uses can generate such stderr output and under
  Windows such output in intermingled with the html produced
  by the cgi script.  In some cases this can corrupt the page,
  or form data passed to subsequent pages (e.g.,IS-137).
  
  Need to control ply's propensity to write error messages to
  stderr.  Also need make sure we don't write errors or warnings
  to stderr ourself in lib modules.
  This does not apply to output that preceeds abnormal termination
  of the script such as a Python traceback also it might be better
  to use the logging modules to control this stuff.

  In rev 48b54fd5ff8a-2009-02-25 added a simple exception handler
  (python/lib/cgitbx.py) to the cgi scripts to dump traceback to 
  page after getting sick of digging the info out of the web server
  log file on Unix systems.  Did not use standard Python cgitb
  module because it is overkill and looks ugly as sin.

  In changeset b1a6934e7fb4-2010-04-16, python/lib/jelparse.y was 
  modified to prevent the Ply parser from writing output files with
  such gay abandon.
