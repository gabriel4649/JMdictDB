  "Entry groups" collect entries into ordered groups.
  There are several applications of this capability:
 
  * Subdivision of corpus's.  For example, given a corpus
    of vocab words from a textbook, entry groups can be
    used group word into sublists by chapter, and order
    the words to match the list order.
    (pro: may eliminate the need for entr.srcnotes which
    I currently use to do this.)

  * Group sentences that together provide a dialog.

  * Semantic categorization of entries.  For example, a
    group "food" can be created and food-related words
    assigned to it.
    (con: categories used for this really should be hierarchial.)
    (con: FLD tags are more appropriate since they are sense
    based.)
    (con: a more fully-featured WordNet approach might be
    better.)
