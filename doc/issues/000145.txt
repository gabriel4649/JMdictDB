  Edict2 import capability would be very handy for doing
  bulk data import.  jwb also requested this, see email 
  "Re jmdictdb progress", 2009-02-23 and 2009-02-24.

  Have already started this a few months ago and have some
  basic code and tests.

  Commiting edparse.py, an edict2 parser written from scratch
  (after review didn't like the code I'd written before).
  I lot of my understanding of edict2 format came from Jean-
  Luc Leger's "to_edict2.xsl stylesheet, added to jmdictdb as
  python/lib/edict2.xsl.
