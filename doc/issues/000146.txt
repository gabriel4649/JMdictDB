  Edict2/Edict export capability would be very handy for 
  generating files for use in other systems since it is a 
  widely used format.

  In email "Re: jmdictdb progress", 2009-02-09 and 2009-02-24, Jim 
  Breen mentions that he has some XSLT written by Jean-Luc Leger that
  will transform jmdict xml into edict.  If that xslt is shareable, 
  it might be the easiet way to generate edict format.
