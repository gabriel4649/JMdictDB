  Edict2/Edict export capability would be very handy for 
  generating files for use in other systems since it is a 
  widely used format.

  An edict formating function in the python api would also
  be useful for producing entry summary lines in reports and
  such.

  Another wish list item would be database function that 
  generated edict text lines which would make edict available 
  to any app with access to the database.

  In email "Re: jmdictdb progress", 2009-02-09 and 2009-02-24, Jim 
  Breen mentions that he has some XSLT written by Jean-Luc Leger that
  will transform jmdict xml into edict.  If that xslt is shareable, 
  it might be the easiet way to generate edict format.
  However it requires an xslt and operates on a full xml file (with
  dtd)

  Adding python/lib/xslfmt.py, a function to apply an arbitrary
  xslt stylesheet to an jmdictdb wml-formatted entry.  By applying
  python/lib/edict2.xsl (a modified version of Jean-Luc Leger's 
  to_edict2.xsl stylesheet), edict2 formtted text can be generated
  from with jmdictdb xml, or a jmdictdb Entr object.
  Have also started writing a conventional Entr->Edict format
  function.

  Added new module, python/lib/edfmt.py that will format edict2
  compatible text output from an entr object.
  This will replace the xslfmt module, but is currently still 
  incomplete (doesn't do lsrc or xrefs, no tests, little to
  no testing yet.
