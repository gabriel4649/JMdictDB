  A common editing need in jmdict is to merge two entries.
  The database does not provide any way to track the history 
  of two or more parents (to avoid the inherent complexities 
  seen in revision control systems like Mercurial or Bazaar),
  so the process of merging two entries is:

  1) Edit the surviving entry E1 and copy-paste info from the
    non-surviving entry into it.  In the comments note that 
    this entry was merged from the entry E2 (the non-surviving 
    entry).  Optionally one could copy the history text of the 
    non-surviving entry into the comment of the surviving one.
    (But display of the history might look awful on a web page
    due to reformatting done in conversion to html.)

  2) Edit the non-surviving entry E2 and mark it for deleteion.
    In the comments note that it was merged  with E1.

  However, the jmdictdb system could provide some help that 
  automates some of the above process.

  One possible option: Allow edform to accept more than one 
  entry (a'la the entr form).  Then one would have both entries
  in the same page to enable copy-paste.  Additionally, edform.py
  could get an option that would tell it to mark the second
  entry as deleted and insert some boilerplate text in the comments
  of each entry.

  Alternatively, a dedicated "merge" edit form could be written
  that behaves the same wway, but has the input boxes for each
  entry side-by-side.

  Edform.py/edform.tal will now display multiple entries for 
  edit, if that helps.
