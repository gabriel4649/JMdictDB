  The version of edict2.xsl commited after de814571423c (2009-03-07)
  works without a DTD, but to make this possible, I removed the 
  expressions that limited glosses to only english.  The stylesheet
  relied on the DTD providing a default <xml:lang="eng"> tag to all
  untagged glosses which it used to limit its selection of glosses.

  Need to either: 
  (1) modify the code to limit gloss selection to untagged glosses
  or explicitly "eng" tagged glosses, or, 
  (2) Adopt a convention for tagging non-english glosses in edict
  and have the stylesheet generate them appropriately.
