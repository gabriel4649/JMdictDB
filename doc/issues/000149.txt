  While writing tests for xslfmt.py noticed that Jean-Luc Leger's
  "to_edict2.xsl" stylesheet produces an Edict "(P)" tag when an
  entry has any kanji or readings with the freq tag, "spec2".
  The JMdict XML comments say, "The entries with news1, ichi1, 
  spec1 and gai1 values are marked with a (P) in the EDICT and
  EDICT2 files." which I used as my criteria for generating P
  tags in JMdictDB (c.f. pg/mkviews.sql, function 'is_p'.)

  On reviewing the Edict maillist posts, found post from Jean-Luc
  Leger, "Documenting the P's", 2007-01-02, and a reply from Jim
  Breen saying the "spec2" was a sufficient criterium for a P, and
  giving the reasons why.

  Need to update code to take this into account.

  Jim Breen confirmed on the edict-editors list today ("P tags")
  that 'spec2' should be included in the P criteria.  Also said
  the that current spec2 tags will eventually be changed to spec1
  or removed resulting in the elimination of spec2.

  Updated sql view 'is_p' to include 'spec2'.  Also fixed another 
  problem, see IS-201 for details including construction and 
  application of patch.
