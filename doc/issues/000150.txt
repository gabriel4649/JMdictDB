  Currently the <xref> elements in the jmdict-ex.xml DTD 
  allow for including seq number and corpus information 
  (via attributes) in addition to the kanji, reading, and
  sense info in the xref element value.
  However, if the xref is not imediately resolved to an
  Xref upon reading, there is no way to preserve this 
  information in an Xrslv object.

  Also consider: xref order is lost if some xrefs are in
  the Entr's _xref list and some in its _xrslv list.  
  Perhaps we should have single _xref list containing both
  Xref and Xrslv objects?
