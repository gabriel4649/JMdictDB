  After a fresh load of jmdict into the database, noticed that
  entry seq 1206100 has gloss in sense 4:

    > third degree (of the Japanese amp Chinese pentatonic scale)

  The "amp" should have been "&", and is correctly "&amp;" in
  the input jmdict XML file:

    <gloss>third degree (of the Japanese &amp; Chinese pentatonic scale)</gloss>
