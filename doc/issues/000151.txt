  After a fresh load of jmdict into the database, noticed that
  entry seq 1206100 has gloss in sense 4:

    third degree (of the Japanese amp Chinese pentatonic scale)

  The "amp" should have been "&", and is correctly "&amp;" in
  the input jmdict XML file:

    <gloss>third degree (of the Japanese &amp; Chinese pentatonic scale)</gloss>

  Change priority to "critical".  This problem also affects the angle
  brackets in the xml tags of the history diffs corrupting them to
  "lt" and "gt" and corrupting the diffs.

  The xml file from which my personal corpora was loaded contains correctly
  encoded entities, however the .pgi file produced by jmparse exhibits the
  problem confirming that the problem is happrning in jmparse.
  For reference,the changes I recall making After the data load (and which 
  will need to be redone were:
    mnn chap 7 missing audio clips.
    mnn chap 7 missing entry and audio for itadakimasu.
