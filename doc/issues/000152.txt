  The function audio.playfile() seems to (sometimes? always?)
  truncate the clip being played.  When I play an audio segment
  from an mp3 file with start and length accurately determined
  with Audacity, the last few hundred milliseconds of the clip
  is not played.

  Not sure where the problem is.  Could be endpoint calulations
  in my code (audio.py or mci.py), or the times audacity gives
  have some offset.  Or possibly the problem is different mp3
  decoders used by audacity and microsoft's mci.

  For now, added a fixed 400 mS padding to whatever length is
  passed to audio.playfile().  Don't want to spend much time on 
  this since the audio needs to be replaced with something platform
  independent anyway.
