  Recent parse of jmdict produced log message imforming
  of addition of new DIAL (dilect) keyword, "nab" for
  "nagano-ben".  Check of the jmdict.xml file's dtd has
  it documented there.

  Added line to pg/data/dial.csv:

    11\tnab\tnagano-ben

  Replaced python/lib/dtd-jmdict.xml with copy of dtd 
  extracted from the 2009-09-09 jmdict.xml file.
  Added the new <!ENTITY nab> line to python/lib/- 
    dtd-jmdict-ex.xml

  Added test 192 for new keyword to python/tests/test_jdb_kwds.py.
  Manually insert the new keyword in the jmdict.kwdial table so 
  that the above test will pass untill the next database reload.
