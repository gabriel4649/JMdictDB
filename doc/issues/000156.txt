  I am under the impression that some changes need 
  to be made to the jmdictdb code to allow it to work
  with Ply-3.x rather than Ply-2.5 which it has been
  using.

  Installed Ply-3.3 (the current version) on Nara and
  was able to rebuild jelparse.py from jelparse.y.  Also
  able to add/edit entries via the web interface which
  used the new jelpasrse.py so it seems Ply-3.3 works
  out of the box and no change to the jmdictdb code is 
  needed.
