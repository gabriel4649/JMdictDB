 The Examples file from Jim Breen (which he derives from the Tatoeba
 project, http://www.tatoeba.com) has ID numbers at the end of
 each "A" line that I thought were usable as a JMdict-like "seq" 
 number.  However, as pointed out by Jim Breen on the Edict list 
 today, and in http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus,
 the numbers are not unique and multiple sentence pairs that share
 a common english sentence will have the same ID#.

 So it seems that we're back to the jmnedict situation, when 
 reimporting the corpus, of having to compare it to the previous
 import, eliminate exact matches between the two, and using 
 hueristics to try and match the differences.  WAFPITA.

 Sometime in last few months the format of the ID numbers changed
 from ID#=nnnn to ID#=nnnn_mmmm where nnnn and mmmm are the Tatoeba
 english and japanese sentence id's.  IS-192 describes the how
 the Example sentence seq numbers are now derived from this composite
 id.  This I hope will eliminate duplicate seq numbers.  It remains
 to be seen if these id numbers are stable.

 After importing today's Examples file with the IS-192 changes,
 there were no duplicate seq numbers.
