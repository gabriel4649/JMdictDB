 The Examples file from Jim Breen (which he derives from the Tatoeba
 project, http://www.tatoeba.com) has ID numbers at the end of
 each "A" line that I thought were usable as a JMdict-like "seq" 
 number.  However, as pointed out by Jim Breen on the Edict list 
 today, and in http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus,
 the numbers are not unique and multiple sentence pairs that share
 a common english sentence will have the same ID#.

 So it seems that we're back to the jmnedict situation, when 
 reimporting the corpus, of having to compare it to the previous
 import, eliminate exact matches between the two, and using 
 hueristics to try and match the differences.  WAFPITA.
