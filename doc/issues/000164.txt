  Currently the srchsql (formerly srchadv) page provides 
  an interface to allow a database search using arbitrary 
  SQL.  The search (and access control) is done in srchres.py.
  config.ini controls access to this ability in srchres.py
  but currently provides for only full access, editor-
  only access or no access.  Because executing arbitrary 
  sql gives the ability of not only of full access to the
  Postgresql server, but likely to the server machine as
  well, it would be desirable to allow access only to
  certain designated users rather than (or in addition 
  to) all "editors".  This is low priority because by
  default, access is set to none.
