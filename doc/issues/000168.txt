  In email from jwb, 2010-06-07, 
  (Subject: "Useful check (Fwd: Output from "cron" command)"),
  he asked about adding to edconf.py checks for unbalanced parenthesis
  or curly brackets in gloss texts.

  Additionally in 2010-06-08 email (same subject) he suggested also
  checking gloss texts for tab characters or double space characters
  and that he also sometimes sees JIS spaces and punctuation characters
  in glosses.  JIS characters in PoS tags was also mentioned but:
  1) those should result in a parse error; 2) perhaps they should be
  detected and quietly converted to ascii in the jel parser.

  Note that stringent checking assumes one can accurately predict what
  will need to go into an entry: jmdictdb rev a0f1cb04b0d5-2010-06-18
  removed the kana check on readings because it turned out to be
  desireable to ignore the documented requirement that readings are
  kana when processing edict input from the wwwjdic pages.
