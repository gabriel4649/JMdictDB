  Ran edparse.entr() over the full edict2 file (pre-2010/06/22 
  versionj that has tags in old order) and it failed to parse
  16 lines due to four problems.

  54 Kanji field not kanji: "・".
  55 Kanji field not kanji: "・".
  68 Kanji field not kanji: "〜".
  71 Kanji field not kanji: "×".
  1326 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  27347 stagx restriction word neither reading or kanji: "wearing"
  38357 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  38358 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  38378 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  52071 Xref "anti-war", bad format
  54205 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  69929 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  109666 Kanji field not kanji: "・".
  113190 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  127455 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings
  131390 P tag in sense, but not in kanji or readings

  Line 27347 is 
    パンツ一丁 [パンツいっちょう] /(n) (wearing only) one pair of underpants/EntL2266560X/
  Parser sees the "... only)" as a stag signatuture.

  Line 52071 is 
    活動家 [かつどうか] /(n) (anti-war) activist/(P)/EntL1208370X/
  I think it is seeing "(ant" as an xref antonym signaure.

  The "Kanji field not kanji" error is a jstr_classify
  issue (see also closed issue IS-26).

  The "P tag" failures occur because there is a P tag on sense but 
  more than one kanji or reading.  It was my understanding that 
  this would not occur.

  
  Line 1326 is:
    お目出度うご座います;御目出度う御座います [おめでとうございます] /(exp) (uk) congratulations/(P)/EntL1001540/

  Here is the full entry:
    jmdict 1001540 Active {id:136}
    お目出度うご座います ； 御目出度う御座います
    【 おめでとうございます [ spec1] 】
      1. [exp] [uk]
       ▶ congratulations

  python/lib/edparse.py was not finding "EntLnnnnnnn" pseudo-glosses.
