  When I click a help link on the Arakawa test edit form page,
  I get a parameters error page that says: 

    Error
    We're sorry but your page request could not be processed
      due to the following error(s):
      * db_jmdict

  Bad message (but that's a separate issue) but it means that 
  parseform() was unable to open the jmdict database.  Reason
  is that I recently removed access to jmdict database from the 
  test pages.  

  Problem is that the help page needs access to the database
  because it has to read things like the keywords tables, but
  it gets no "svc" parameter so it tries to open database jmdict
  by default.

  Need to fix the links in the TAL file so that the current 
  svc parameter (and sid, although that is not currently needed)
  is also passed.

  Changed links like:

    <a class="helplink" target="edhelp"
      href="edhelp.py#corpus">help</a>

  to

    <a class="helplink"
      tal:attributes="href string:edhelp.py?svc=${svc}&amp;#corpus">
