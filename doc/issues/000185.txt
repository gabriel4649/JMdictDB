  Paul Blay posted a url to a entr.py page by cut-and-paste:
  http://www.edrdg.org/jmdictdb/cgi-bin/entr.py?svc=jmdict&sid=4405220254011143696&q=6.99
  Anyone who opens this url will get Paul's session.  The problem 
  is aggrevated by both the increase in session timeout, and the 
  reuse of a single session, both changes made in the previous
  revision.

  Need to make sure that any forms or generated urls either use
  post method, or don't pass the sid parameter.

  Fine, but what about links that contain an sid (each page has 
  dozens of them)?

  Possible options...

  Don't pass sid in links at all.  Only people not using cookies
  will have a problem and the problem will be loss of logged-in
  status when following links, but not when following process workflow
  linked by buttons.  

  Added a propogated param that says not to use cookies; use sid
  in url only if not using cookies.  Non-cookie users responsible 
  for stripping the uid value before posting links.

  I intend to add ip address logging fo other reasons.  Could use 
  for authentication by logging ip addr at session creation and
  require it to be the same when validating sid.
