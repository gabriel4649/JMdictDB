  When displaying entries for a given src/seq number, we display
  the entire edit tree of entries.  But much of the info in the 
  non-leaf entries is redundent.
  Perhaps we could display only leaf entries, and add a link or 
  button in the history entries to get to the full entry display
  of non-leaf entries?  (I made this suggestion on jmdict_editors
  list on 2010-07-17, "Multiple amendments on the same submissions/-
  output page".)  This coud be done eiher server-side or, using
  some javascript, client-side by hiding the redundent entries.

  Question: how will this interact with search when the search
  results include a non-leaf entry, not not the coresponding
  leaf entry?  Or maybe the idea is only for when we have 
  something like a "entr.py?q=nnnnnnn" page?  Probably needs
  to be different page than entr.py.
