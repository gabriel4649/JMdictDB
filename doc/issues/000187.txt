  The was requested by Jeroen Hoekm on the edict list, 2010-06-19
  and was also part of IS-4 (which is superceded by this IS).

  Besides submitter search, would also like search by comment
  date (or date range), and string/pattern in comments or references.

  Added section to python/lib/tmpl/srchform.tal to allow exact or
  wildcard search on submitter name, lower and upper bound dates,
  and selection of any, first or last history records.
  web/cgi/srchres.py and python/lib/jmcgi.py (function so2conds()):
  handle new 'smtr', 'ts' and 'mt' parameters from srchform.tal. 

  Have not implemented search in comments or refs yet.  Will save that
  for some future time.
