  Currently there is an web/cgi/updates.py page that reuses the 
  entr.tal template and shows the submissions for a given date.
  However  it would be nice to have a page like 
    http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/dicsubs/
  that allows looking through past months and years,

  Jwb put together a page that gives submissions for recent 
  dates:
    http://www.edrdg.org/jmdictdb/databaseupdates.html
  but it is maintained by a cron job and is html so lacks the 
  standard JMdictDB header/footer.  It will also become too
  "thick" after it accumulates a couple months of history.

  Should also consider not showing full entries but just a sumary
  list like Search Results page (with additional info like date-time
  and submitter.)
