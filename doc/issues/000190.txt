  jwb and others have requested that the submission forms check that 
  every sense has a PoS and that the submission be rejected if not.
  Currently, there is a warning on the Confirmation page if the entry
  has a PoS-less sense, but apparently, some submitters have been
  ignoring it.  Se edict and editors list around 2010-07-23.

  This IS overlaps somewhat with IS-168, "Additional submission checks
  in edconf.py", but the latter is generally for universal checks that
  can be hardwired into the code whereas this IS is for per-corpus checks,
  or more specifically, the implementation of that capability.

  Possible plan:
  Add column, typ, to kwsrc table.
  Change edconfig  to look for plugin w name based on submitted entry's 
    .src->typ attribute.
  Load the plugin and call a check function with the entry as argument.
    It will return one of three tokens, "ok", "warn" or "prohibit"
    along with a more verbose message. If not "ok" display warning.
  In submission page, do the same but ignore "ok" and "warn", abort
    on "prohibit".
