  Currently doing an automated bulk update of entries in sql 
  is problematic because of the difficulty generating data for
  the hist.diff column.  Without that, one loses the ability 
  to regenerate previous versions of the entry from the diffs.
  So the only other option is to dues bulk updates using the
  JMdictDB API, in particular the submit() function in 
  web/cgi/edsubmit.py which validates an updaet and properly
  generates the histoty (including diffs) and cleanup (deleting
  superceded entries), is very useful.

  Need to pull that function out of edsubmit.py and make it
  available from one of the API modules in python/lib/.
