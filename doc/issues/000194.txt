  When an entry has a restr value such as "モン・クメール語派"
　that would have to be quoted in JEL (because of the middot
  character), fmtjel.py goes not generate any quotes.  This 
  means that if such an entry is edited, it will will result
  in a syntax error even is the entry is submitted unchanged.
  Reported by jwb in editors list email, 2010-09-14. 
  Of course analogous problems may exist with stagr and stagk
  restrictions.
