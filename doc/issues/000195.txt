  Add option to xresolv.py to exclude skip processing xrefs
  of rejected or deleted entries.
  See edict-editors list, "Unresolved xrefs", 2010-11-17.

  Added -i (--ignore-nonactive) option to xresolv.py that will
  skip entries that are deleted, rejected, or unapproved.  
  Rational for the latter is that any unresolvable xrefs will
  be resloved or warned about at approval time so there is no
  point worrying about them prematurely.  Also, one can rerun 
  xresolve.py at any time.
