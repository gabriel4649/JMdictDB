  Jwb added new PoS to the active JMdictDB instance DB and DTD 
  on Arakawa.  Need to make the change in the HG repo as well
  (before the next push to Arakawa.)

  Added "62  vs-c  su verb - precursor to the modern suru" to
  pg/data/kwpos.csv.
  Added to python/lib/dtd-jmdict.xml and dtd-jmdict-ex.xml

  Also made some additional updates based on changes made by jwb
  to the edrdg dtd:

  Added entity "proverb" to dtds.  Missing entity pointed out by
  Ben Bullock on edict list ("JMdict_e: &proverb; entity causing
  parsing problems", 2010-10-25).

  Updated description of gikun in dtd's and kwrinf.csv.
