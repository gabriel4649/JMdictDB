 jwb reports that trying to enter an entry with an lsrc tag
 like [lsrc=eng/w:] fails, which indeed it does (with a syntax
 error from the JEL parser.)

 See also IS-173 which was for a closely related lsrc
 problem although that case resulted in Python traceback,
 rather than syntax error.

 Added tests for lsrc variations to class Lsrc in
 python/tests/test_jelparse.py and coresponding test data 
 to file python/tests/data/jelparse/lsrc.txt.
 The test for [lsrc=eng/w:] fails.

 Problem is there is no syntax in jelparse.y to handle this
 case.  Added rule "TEXT EQL TEXT SLASH TEXT COLON" for this
 case.  The failing case now passes.

 TO DO: document (noting the required trailing colon) in
 the jmedit help file.  Also correct the statement that only 
 text strings with commas or spaces need quoting -- if it
 contains any special character (e.g. slash) it also needs
 quoting.
