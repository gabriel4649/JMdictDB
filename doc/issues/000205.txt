 <jdict.nbarth@xoxy.net>, who requested a check at submission
 time for duplicate reading:

  >> On the JMdictDB entry,
  >> if you accidentally include the same reading twice,
  >> could this be checked and flagged at the confirmation screen?
  >> It currently isnâ€™t flagged, but then when you try to submit,
  >> it fails and you get a cryptic error screen (entry already
  >> exists etc.).

 I suppose same would apply to kanji.
