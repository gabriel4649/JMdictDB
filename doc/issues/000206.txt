 On 2011-05-19, rene.malenfant@gmail.com suggested via private
 mail the idea of a submission kill switch.  When activated for
 a specific submitter, it would redirect to a page that said
 (tactfully) the submitter had been temporarily banned, with
 instructions on how to find out why, get access restored.

 Since there is no user authentication except for editors (the
 "user" field is a voluntarily entered ad-hoc text string) so
 the only practical way is to block by IP address.
 Thus, a prerequisite for this request is IS-188.
