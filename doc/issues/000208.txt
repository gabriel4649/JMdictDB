 In a post to the edict list on 2011-07-04, 
 "xref problem in JMdict/EDICT2", jwb proposed restructuring
 the JMDICT XML schema to remove the ambiguity caused by a 
 middot charactter (ãƒ» in xrefs (is it part of the xref target
 text, or a kanji-kana separator?).  This was propmted by (and
 quotes) a post to sci.lang.japan on 2011-07-04 from 
 blahtemppics@gmail.com.
 The proposal does not address any changes to JEL.
