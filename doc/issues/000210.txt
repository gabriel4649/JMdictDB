 In email to edict list,  For discussion
 see the edict email list, 2011-09-07, "Entry Edit Form: Usability
 improvements", Nils Barth suggested changed the tabindex order of
 the fields in the edit entry form and setting the initial focus
 in order to speed up entry for ferquent contributors.  There was
 some preceeding discussion between me, Nils and Jwb in private
 email.  Not complaints or alternatives were raised in the edict
 list so I will implement.

 Added tabindex attributes to the input fields, buttons and links
 in python/lib/tmpl/edform.tal and macros.tal.  The login fields are
 in macros.tal and are used on many pages.  I retain flexibility in
 tabindex numbers for other pages, I assigned the three items in the
 login aread tabindex numbers between 900 and 999.
 
 Was unable to get the focus code to work.
 Used 

   [...in <head> section...]
   <script  type="text/javascript">
     <!--
     function sf(){document.edform.kanj.focus();}
     -->
     </script>
   ...
   </head>
   <body class="edform" onLoad="inifocus()">
     ...
     <textarea id="kanj" name="kanj" ...>

 but had two problems:
 1) The comment tokens were turned into &lt; and &gt; whrn the template
  was expanded.
 2) Even when the comment tokens were removed, focus was not in the
  kanji box when the form is opened.

 Will commit the tab order change, continue to look at the focus
 problem.
