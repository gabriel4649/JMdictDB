 Added patches/006_01.sql to update a pre-existing database based
 on jwb changes using kwpos.csv, kwfld.csv, kwmisc.csv and the xml
 dtd files as reference.

 Also fixed formatting of this file so that is readable by the
 issue reader software. 

 Noted that new FLD keywords "eng" and "fin" are ambiguous with
 preexisting LANG keywords "english" and "finnish".  This is not 
 a fatal problem but will mean that users have to explicitly
 disabiguate them in some circumstances (e.g. "LANG=eng" rather
 than just "eng").  Emailed jwb.

 Jwb posted note on edict list asking about change
  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/edict-jmdict/message/4752 
 suggesting "engr" and "finc" as replacements.  No negative
 responses to date, one positive one. 
 Updated file pg/data/kwfld.csv, python/tests/
 and created patches/008_01.sql to update running jmdictdb
 instances.

 Forgot to update dtd-jmdict.xml and dtd-jmdict-ex.xml with 
 the "eng"->"engr" and "in"->"finc" change.

 Add new FLD keyword "anat" ("anatomical term", 28).
 Updated patches/008_01.sql rather than create a new patch
 since 008 hasn't been used yet.
