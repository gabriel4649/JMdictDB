 While writing test code, found need to read in entry data
 from xml.  Using jmxml.parse_entry() had a number of quirks,
 in part due to it being one of the first pieces of code 
 written for jmdictdb.

 1) Need to read KWs data and poke it into jdb module.
 2) Need to mkxml() and poke the results into jmxml module.
 3) Entr objects returned by parse_entry() have all the 
    order/links fields (eg, rdng.rdng, sens.sens, gloss.sens,
    gloss.gloss, etc) set.  Jmdictdb convention for entry
    objects an constituents leave these all set to None
    since their value is implicit is the position of the 
    object in its containing list.  They are usually only
    set just before writing to database.  Having them None
    would simplify test code that currently has to change
    these values when position of object in list changes. 

    Should either add option to jmxml to provide Entr objects
    without these fields set, or make non-setting always
    and modify jmparse.py (and whatever else) to call
    jdb.setkeys() before using the Entr objects in the 
    numbering is needed.
 4) I don't think (not sure) the jmxml will parse my extended
    jmdictdb xml format?
