 There are a number of places in the jmdictdb code where
 Xrslv (unresolved xref) need to be resolved to real 
 Xrefs by finding a unique entry with matching reading 
 and kanji.

 But the code to do this has been independently reimplemented 
 in multiple places in the code: 
  * xresolv.py
  * jdb.py (resolv_xref() function)
  * jelparse (resolv_xrefs() function)
  * tests_edconf_realign.py
 We really should unify all these if possible.
