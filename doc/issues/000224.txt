 Will create a mercurial branch named "py2maint" for critial 
 fixes needed for the Python-2 version of JMdictDB currently 
 running at edrdg.org (Jim Breen's wwjdic/jmdict et.al. projects)
 until such time as that site can be moved to the Python-3
 "default" branch which is the main development branch.
