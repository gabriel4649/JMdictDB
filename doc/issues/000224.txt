 Will create a mercurial branch named "py2maint" for critial 
 fixes needed for the Python-2 version of JMdictDB currently 
 running at edrdg.org (Jim Breen's wwjdic/jmdict et.al. projects)
 until such time as that site can be moved to the Python-3
 "default" branch which is the main development branch.

 Note only independent changes or changes merged in from the 
 default branch should occur in this one.  This branch should
 never be merged back into "default" and will eventually be
 closed.

 Backport rev 3be4185d90ee (2012-11-25), IS-221.
 Note that this is only the fix to python/lib/fmtxml.py and does
 not include fixes to the tests or to the IS-121 doc itself.
 See the default branch for those.

 For future reference, generated patch file with:
   hg diff -r 1109 -r 1110 python/lib/fmtxml.py >xx.patch

 Then applied:
  $ patch <xx.patch
  can't find file to patch at input line 4
  Perhaps you should have used the -p or --strip option?
  The text leading up to this was:

  Hunk #2 succeeded at 106 (offset 3 lines).
  Hunk #3 succeeded at 116 (offset 3 lines).
  Hunk #4 succeeded at 213 (offset 3 lines).
  Hunk #5 succeeded at 239 (offset 3 lines).
 Note that I had to manually supply the filename to patch because "hg diff"s
 output is not exactly what is expected by patch.
