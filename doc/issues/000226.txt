 Conjugation of words is done entirely in the database without
 requiring any application-level support.

 Tables defined in pg/conj.sql (and corresponding data to load
 into to them in pg/data/) provide the information needed to
 conjugate words based on their 'pos' tags.  The actual production
 of the onjugated form on words is done in views that are also
 defined in pg/conj.sql.

 The most important table is 'conjo'.  In it is a row for every
 combination of conjugation (past, passive, volitional, etc), 
 plain or formal, affirmative or negative, part-of-speech, and
 a variant number for when is more than one form for a conjugation.
 The column 'okuri' contains the okurigana text for the conjugated
 form.  It also contains columns for the kanji and kana needed when
 a conjugation involves a change in the word stem (くる -> こない
 or 為る-> 出来る for example).

 Table 'copos' associates each part-of-speech with a number that is
 the number of characters to remove from the dictionary form of a 
 word before the okurigana is appended to form te conjugated form.

 Data for table 'conjo' was generated by hand.

 The remaining table are lookup tables and tables for notes to
 be displayed when presenting conjugated words.

 View 'vinfl' provides all the conjugated forms of the words selected.
 View 'vinflxt' provides similar data in the form of a cross-tab table
 with four columns for the aff-plain, neg-plain, aff-formal and neg-
 formal conjugated forms.  

 Both views are effcient and it is practical to select a word by
 seq number, dictionary form kanji or reading, etc.
