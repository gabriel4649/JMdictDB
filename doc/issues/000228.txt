 Corpora listed in table kwsrc have different "types": some are
 contain jmdict entries, some jmnedict, some kanjidic, etc.
 This will enable:
 * Adjust the display of entries depending on the type of
   the corpus.
 * Have different rules for the acceptance of new and updated
   submissions based on type (see IS-190). 
 * DTD used when exporting to XML also selected based io
   corpus type.
 * Remove hardwired corpus id numbers (such as src=1) currently
   used as hack to identify "jmdict" corpus type.

 To-do items (these will be added to as discovered, deleted as done)
 * Add a --corpus option to kdparse.py like jmparse.py, exparse.py?
 * Remove asumptions that certain corpora are of a specific type:
    entrs2xml.py: --help says (under --corpus / examples),
     -s 2         Restrict to corpus id 2 (jmnedict).
    web/cgi/srchform.py: see the #fixme's.

 kwsrc.csv needs data for new column srct added.
 Change pgi.parse_corpus_opt() to parse srct from its 'sopt'
  argument or from a new 4th argument.
 Pull into master default branch code.
