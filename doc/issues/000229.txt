 email to the edict list from jwb:

 A look at a freshly downloaded jmnedict.xml file shows the entity
 used is "work".

 Update dtd template based on freshly downloaded copy of jmnedict.xml.
 There were some textual changes in the comments and a missing entity
 definition for 'organization' that I added in addition to new entity
 'work'.

 In python/lib/dtdjmdict-ex.xml, the MISC enties used in jmnedict 
 were missing, added them.

 Added to pg/data/kwmisc.csv (id=192), python/tests/test-jdb-kwds.py

 Create patches/014.sql to update an existing database. 
 Update dbpatch level in pg/mktables.sql (have been forgetting to 
 do this until now, previous value was still 9!)
