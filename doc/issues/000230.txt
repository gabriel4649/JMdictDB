 Also, when parsing current kanjdic2 file, get errors about 'heisig6'
 as well as 'halpern_kkld_2ed'.  Could not find any reference in my
 saved email or on Google to the heisig6 change.  There are also 3
 errors for 'halpern_kkd', these are probably a typo.  Need to verify
 and inform jwb.

 Need to add new ones to python/kdparse.py.

 'halpern_kkd' is listed in the kanjiic2.xml DTD so not an error.
 Added 'halpern_kkd' (36), 'halpern_kkld_2ed' (37) and 'heisig6'
 (38) to pg/data/kwcinf.csf

 Add patched/015.sql to make same update to existing database.
 and update dbpatch level in pg/mktables.sql to 15.

 Also updated kdparse.py to expect current version od kanjidic2.xml
 file (2014-175) and stop printing "unexpected version" warning.
