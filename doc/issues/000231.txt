 In Postgresql-9.3, the libpq docs describe a url scheme for referencing
 postgresql databases, see
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
 In another project [*], I wrote a parser for such uri's.
 Would like to include that in jdb.py, and in all programs and tools; get
 rid of the -d, -h, u, etc options and replace them with a single -d option
 that will take a uri.
