*CAUTION*  Development/verification of rad.csv is still in progress.

The data in rad.csv was compiled from the following sources:
  http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/radicalnames.html
  Kadansha Kanji Lerner's Dictionary, Halpern Ed., 2001.
  Kangxi Radicals (Unicode Consortium)
    http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2F00.pdf
  CJK Radicals Supplement (Unicode Consortium)
    http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E80.pdf
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kangxi_radicals
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_214

To do:
 Remove or replace examples characters that are not in kanjidic.
 Remove radical variants that are not used in kanjidic characters
  (but a few are listed in Halpern, and others may be used in 
  jis-213 but i can't see because of no suitable font.) 

Questions...
12.1	Some of these examples should be moved to 12.2, 12.3?
29	Unable to find any characters that look like Halpern's first 
	 and I presume Breen's second) "mata" character, so ignored it.
47.2	Wikipedia listed èB as an example?  Is that right?  kanjidic
	 gives that character's radical as #6.
92	The 'chr' character listed is a 5-stroke variant?
122.3	Is 2EB4 the right radical for the rad column?
129	Expand with the two additional characters in rad supplement, 
	 even though not in Halpern, Breen, or Wikip?
130.3	Is 2EBC the right radical for the rad column?
180.1	Halpern shows top line is horiz.  Examples I picked have angled
	 top line as might be written.  Is this right.  Variant and
	 it's examples have a vertical top line.
184.1	
193	Halpern/Breen have two versions but they have identical shape
	 and name (afaict) so I took as one.
199.2	Is example baku or bakunyo?
200.3	Examples correct?
200.4	Examples correct? (added first two from kanjidic.)
