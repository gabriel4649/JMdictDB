pg/data/

The files in this directory hold data for the jmdict 
keywords.  This data is both loaded into the database
kw* tables, and used to generate python contstants that
are included by various python scripts.  After any changes 
are made to the .csv files here, "make" should be run
in python/lib/ to update those constants (in python/lib/-
kwstatic.py).

The data in kwlang.csv was generated by tools/mklang.py
from the table of ISO-639-2 language codes downloadable 
from:
 ISO-639-2 (1998) http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
See issue IS-110 for more details.

See file rad.txt for more inforation on the data on rad.csv.
