1	"Irregular conjugation.  Note that this not the same as the definition of ""irregular verb""
 commonly found in textbooks (typically する and 来る).  It denotes okurigana that is different
 than other words of the same class.  Thus the past tense of 行く (行った) is an irregular
 conjugation because other く (v5k) verbs use いた as the okurigana for this conjugation. 
 します is not an irregular conjugation because we take する to behave as
 a v1 verb and the okurigana is the same as other v1 verbs despite the sound change of the
 stem (す) part of the verb to し."
2	na-adjectives and nouns are usually used with the なら nara conditional, instead of with であれば de areba. なら is a contracted and more common form of ならば.
3	では is often contracted to じゃ in colloquial speech.
4	The (first) non-abbreviated form is obtained by applying sequentially the causative, then passive conjugations.
5	The -まい negative form is literary and rather rare. 
6	The ら is sometimes dropped from -られる, etc. in the potential form in conversational Japanese, but it is not regarded as grammatically correct.
