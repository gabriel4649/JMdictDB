# This is an example program demonstrating how the JMdictDB word
# conjugation tables can be used, idependently of the rest of the
# JMdictDB API, to conjugate Japanese words.
#
# It will print a table of conjugations for the word given
# on the command line.  You are required to supply the word's
# part-of-speech code as used in wwwjdic, JMdict, et.al, since
# this program in independent of JMdictDB and has no other way
# to determine it.  Run this program with "--help" for full
# details on the command line arguments and options.
#
# It would be a straight-forward exercise to change this code
# to look the word up in a JMdict database to get the part-
# of-speech value automatically or to format the output more
# nicely, etc.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# JMdictDB uses a set of five csv (comma separated value) tables
# that contain information needed to conjugate japanese words
# based on the words' part-of-speech code (e.g., v1 verb, v5k verb,
# i-adjective, etc).  In JMdictDB these data are loaded into database
# tables and the word conjugation done via SQL views.
#
# However it is also possible to using read these csv files directly
# in an application program and do the conjugation in code; this
# program is an example of that.
#
# This program conjugates words using primarily the conjugation
# data in file .../conjo.csv.  That file consists of rows of 9
# values per row:
#
#    pos:   A part-of-speech number.  These are defined in kwpos.csv
#           and each number corresponds to a keyword like 'v1', 'v5k'
#           'n', 'vs, adj-i', etc, as used in wwwjdict, JMdict.xml,
#           etc.
#    conj:  A conjugation number.  These are defined in conj.csv.
#    neg:   If false, this row is for the affirmative conjugation
#           form.  If true, for the negative form.
#    fml:   If false, this row is for the plain conjugation form.
#           If true, for the formal (aka polite) form.
#    onum:  A disambiguating number (starting from 1) for rows
#           containing variant okurigana for the same conjugation
#           (e.g., ～なくて and ～ないで).
#    okuri: The okurigana text for the conjugated form.
#    euphr: Replacement kana text for the verb stem in cases where
#           there is a euphonic change in the stem (e.g. く -> こ in
#           来る -> 来ない).
#    euphk: Replacement kanji text when there is a kanji change in
#           the stem.  (The only case of this is for the Potential
#           conjugation form of suru: 為る・する -> 出来る・できる).
#    pos2:  Not used.
#
# The first five items form a unique key identifying each
# conjugation and are used as a key in the python dicts in the
# code below to identify conjugations.  The remaining items in
# each row are used to contruct the conjugated form of a word
# for the conjugation specified by the key.

# The file .../copos.csv contains two columns: the first is a part-
# of-speech (pos) number, the second a small number that is the
# number of characters to remove from the end of a dictionary form
# of a word before adding the okurigana text to conjugate it which
# we'll call trim count ('trimcnt' in the code below).
#
# Thus, the algorithm for conjugating a word is to identify what
# part-of-speech the words is and get the corresponding pos number.
# With that, get the trim count (we'll call it 'trimcnt') from
# copos.csv.  Then for each (or a desired) conjugation in conjo.csv
# identified by (pos,conj,neg,fml,onum), get okuri, euphr, euphk.
# If the word to be conjugated is kana and euphr is non-null,
# replace the word with euphr.  Same for a kanji word and euphk.
# If euphr (or euphk) is null then remove trimcnt characters from
# the end of the word and append okuri.  That's it!
#
# The other csv tables are:
#    conj.csv: Maps each conj number to a descriptive text.
#    conotes.csv: A set of test notes, each identified by an
#         id number.
#    conjo_notes.csv: Maps notes in conotes.csv (identified
#         by id number) to conjugations in conjo.csv
#         (identified by (pos,conj,neg,fml,onum)).
#
# See also:
# pg/conj.sql -- contains SQL views that perform the same
# operations as this program using the .csv data read into
# database tables.  Those views provide the conjugated words
# for the web/cgi/conj.py JMdictDB web page.
