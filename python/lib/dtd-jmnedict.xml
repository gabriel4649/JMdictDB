	This is the DTD of the Japanese-Multilingual Named Entity

	of the ENAMDICT entries, plus the name entries from EDICTH.

<!--                                                                   -->
<!ELEMENT entry (k_ele*, r_ele+, trans+)*>
	<!-- Entries consist of kanji elements, reading elements 
	name translation elements. Each entry must have at 
	least one reading element and one sense element. Others are optional.
	-->
<!ELEMENT k_ele (keb, ke_inf*, ke_pri*)>
	<!-- The kanji element, or in its absence, the reading element, is 
	the defining component of each entry.
	The overwhelming majority of entries will have a single kanji
	element associated with an entity name in Japanese. Where there are 
	multiple kanji elements within an entry, they will be orthographical
	variants of the same word, either using variations in okurigana, or
	alternative and equivalent kanji. Common "mis-spellings" may be 
	included, provided they are associated with appropriate information
	fields. Synonyms are not included; they may be indicated in the
	cross-reference field associated with the sense element.
	-->
<!ELEMENT keb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element will contain an entity name in Japanese 
	which is written using at least one non-kana character (usually
	kanji, but can be other characters). The valid 
	characters are kanji, kana, related characters such as chouon and 
	kurikaeshi, and in exceptional cases, letters from other alphabets.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This is a coded information field related specifically to the 
	orthography of the keb, and will typically indicate some unusual
	aspect, such as okurigana irregularity.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_pri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This and the equivalent re_pri field are provided to record
	information about the relative priority of the entry, and are for
	use either by applications which want to concentrate on entries of 
	a particular priority, or to generate subset files. The reason
	both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because on
	occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
	kanji/reading pair.
	-->
<!--                                                                   -->
<!ELEMENT r_ele (reb, re_restr*, re_inf*, re_pri*)>
	<!-- The reading element typically contains the valid readings
	of the word(s) in the kanji element using modern kanadzukai. 
	Where there are multiple reading elements, they will typically be
	alternative readings of the kanji element. In the absence of a 
	kanji element, i.e. in the case of a word or phrase written
	entirely in kana, these elements will define the entry.
	-->
<!ELEMENT reb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- this element content is restricted to kana and related
	characters such as chouon and kurikaeshi. Kana usage will be
	consistent between the keb and reb elements; e.g. if the keb
	contains katakana, so too will the reb.
	-->
<!ELEMENT re_restr (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate when the reading only applies
	to a subset of the keb elements in the entry. In its absence, all
	readings apply to all kanji elements. The contents of this element 
	must exactly match those of one of the keb elements.
	-->
<!ELEMENT re_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- General coded information pertaining to the specific reading.
	Typically it will be used to indicate some unusual aspect of 
	the reading. -->
<!ELEMENT re_pri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- See the comment on ke_pri above. -->
<!ELEMENT trans (name_type*, trans_det*)>
	<!-- The trans element will record the translational equivalent
	of the Japanese name, plus other related information. 
	-->
<!ELEMENT name_type (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- The type of name, recorded in the appropriate entity codes.
	-->
<!ELEMENT trans_det (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- The actual translations of the name, usually as a transcription
	into the target language.
	-->
<!ATTLIST trans_det xml:lang CDATA #IMPLIED>
	<!-- The xml:lang attribute defines the target language of the
	translated name. It will be coded using the three-letter language 
	code from the ISO 639-2 standard. When absent, the value "eng" 
	(i.e. English) is the default value. The bibliographic (B) codes
	are used.-->
