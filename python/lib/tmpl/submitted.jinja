      <p><b>Thank you for your contribution!</b></p>

      <p>Your update(s) have been added to the JMdict database.</p>

      <p>If you are not an editor, your update(s) has been added to the
        database with provisional status and will be added to the JMdict XML,
        Edict and other dictionaries after approval by an editor.  Comments
        and questions regarding your submission may be added to the entry
        before approval.  Click on the Id# link or Seq# links below to see
        the status of your submission.  The Id# link will become inactive
        after approval but you will still be able to see the comments in 
        the history section of the entry shown by Seq#.</p>

      <p>If your submission was done as an editor, then the Approve,
        Delete, or Reject status becomes effective immediately.</p>
