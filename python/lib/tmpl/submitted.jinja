      <p><b><i>Thank you for your contribution!</i></b></p>

      <p>Your update has been added to the JMdict database.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are not an editor, your update has been added to the
          database with provisional status and will be added to the JMdict
          XML, Edict and other dictionaries after approval by an editor.</li>
        <li>
          If your submission was done as an editor, then the Approve,
          Delete, or Reject status becomes effective immediately.</li>
        <li>
          Comments and questions regarding your submission, to which you
          may wish to respond, may be added to the entry before or during
          approval.
          Click on the Id# link or Seq# links below to see them and the
          status of your submission.</li>
        <li>
          The Id# link may become inactive
          after approval but you will still be able to see the comments
          in the history section of the entry shown by Seq#.</li>
